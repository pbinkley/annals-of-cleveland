the loyal states have increased their population since 1860. This fact<br/>
was brought out in the President's message. The net increase is well<br/>
over 100,000, which shows that there are still plenty of men to carry<br/>
on the war and to put down the Rebellion.<br/>
"It is the wonderful growth of the North that alarmed the Rebels in<br/>
days gone by. They knew they would inevitably be out-voted in the leg-<br/>
islative halls of the nation and sought, therefore, to escape the con-<br/>
sequences by plunging into this strife. The dream of a great slave<br/>
empire bordering on the Gulf is forever gone. The free population of -<br/>
the North is to inherit the South." (8)<br/>

preaching mere ceremonies. Clergymen of today need to be practical as<br/>
well as religious and to assume an attitude equal to their fellowmen.<br/>
Peculiarities that weaken the influence of a minister are his underesti-<br/>
mation of the ability and intelligence of his audience and the practice<br/>
of written sermons. Another peculiarity is, that ministers spend too<br/>
much time among books and not enough among living people. - --<br/>

"A few hours spent each day conversing with men of all classes and opin-<br/>
ions, not only familiarizes the minister with the feeling of men on relig-<br/>
ious ideas, but brings them into more active sympathy with the world. There<br/>
is far too little of hearty communication with the world and too much priestly<br/>
isolation from the living, suffering, and hoping human hearts of today."<br/>

We may, with the integrity of the Union, anticipate a homogeneous peo-<br/>

181 - L Nov. 25:2/3-5 - The Rev. W. Allen Fiske, rector of Grace church,<br/>
delivered a sermon yesterday based upon the test of "Fveryone that asketh,<br/>
receiveth." He said: "It is a great mistake to suppose, as many have<br/>
done, that men may pray and pray, yet receive no reply.... 'Everyone that<br/>
asketh receiveth" ... an ungodly nation must of necessity reap the vengeance<br/>
of the Almighty, while a faithful and prayerful people will as certainly<br/>
reap his blessing.... statesmen alone can never save a people.... God estimates<br/>
a nation...by the character of its people....neither President nor armies<br/>
can save us... God alone can save, and unless our sins as a nation are so<br/>
ripe, that our death has been decreed, God will save us in answer to the<br/>
submission, humiliation, and prayer of our people.... The immediate cause of<br/>
all our troubles being the want of purity and unselfish patriotism in the<br/>
national councils, let us seek to deserve, and pray God to raise up to us<br/>
leaders with whom unselfish love of country shall prevail over every other<br/>
consideration." (28)<br/>

"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies." He<br/>
contrasted the present prosperity during the war with the want and slaugh-<br/>
ter of past wars. He praised the North for their "progress of freedom".<br/>
and all the good they were doing and had done. "In view of all this, is<br/>
there any man before me who dare allow the finger of his conscience to in-<br/>
scribe upon his country's sword the word, 'failure'?... The 8th of November<br/>
was the most anxious day in history, but its sun set in a cloud of trium-<br/>
phant glory. The result was one for which we have sung, and wept, and<br/>
prayed, and talked, and worked. Those who think the war a failure, and who<br/>
must therefore regard the 8th of November as the gloomiest day in history,<br/>
had better, like Job, clothe themselves with the sackcloth and sit in the<br/>
ashes of repentence." (23)<br/>

232 - L. Aug. 9; ed: 2/1 - Mary young men and women have been graduated<br/>
from various colleges during these past weeks, and with a large portion of<br/>
them, the diploma is only an "evidence that a certain amount of time has<br/>
been spent within the bounds of some particular educational institution."<br/>
They have failed to achieve the fundamentals set forth in the college<br/>
curriculum which makes for an education of which one is to be proud.<br/>
Another phase of college life is prevalent, however, in the colleges<br/>
of the west, which are more favorable to the general distribution of a<br/>
moderately good education than are New England colleges, though a vast<br/>
improvement could be made, because both eastern and western colleges turn<br/>
out "graduates who could scarcely be admitted into the freshman year of<br/>
the best colleges in the country."<br/>
Scholarships in western colleges are denominational, and students<br/>
cramped by theological opinions are apt to become intolerant bigots.<br/>
- "If the majority of colleges could be merely tributaries for universi-<br/>
ties of such magnificent facilities as are possessed by some of the German<br/>
universities, there would be a stouter, heartier race of thinkers and<br/>
scholars than prevails under the present system." (18)<br/>

cause. Everything looks charming to Seddon. He agrees with Davis that<br/>
the fall of Atlanta means little, although Governor Brown of Georgia<br/>
says that "it is the very heart and railroad center of the Confederacy,<br/>
and the loss was a severe blow." Seddon reviews the military situation<br/>
by saying that the Rebels have resisted efforts of the enemy by defeat-<br/>
ing the largest and best appointed armies, and have thwarted best laid<br/>
plans. "We have shown ourselves to be worthy of that separate and equal<br/>
place among the nations of the earth which is our birthright, and which<br/>
has been unjustly withheld from us." He discusses the question of main-<br/>
taining the Rebel armies, also of arming the slaves. He then gives a<br/>
review of the conditions of the Rebel cavalry and of the Rebel prisoners<br/>
in our hands. He attempts justification of horrible atrocities inflicted<br/>
upon Union soliiers in their hands, by saying that the effective drain<br/>
by the blockade on their limited resources justified them in taking care<br/>
of their own men first. He winds up his harangue by holding out the<br/>
threat of arming slaves by way of retaliation. "Do it, we say, we are<br/>
anxious to have the last resource of the Confederacy brought forward.<br/>
This will complete all labors... except one, and that is, that this in-<br/>

Constitution of the United States: That Congress he authorized to make<br/>

direct taxes shall be apportioned among the states of the Union; to<br/>
abolish the provision that a person held to service in one state and<br/>

Sec. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this act.<br/>

287 - L June 18; ed:2/1 - The recent vote by which the constitutional<br/>
amendment was lost, so far as the vote from Ohio is concerned, is one<br/>
of the most flagrant outrages that have been perpetrated against the<br/>
honor of our state for many years. Fourteen Democratic Congressmen have<br/>
decided that the source and strength of the Rebellion shall not be<br/>
weakened or extirpated so far as their services can prevent it. The<br/>
Democrats in Congress have decided not to allow the people to say whether<br/>
they will so amend the constitution as to prevent the reestablishment<br/>
of slavery on the soil of the Republic.<br/>
"This action of the Democracy in Congress prefigures the action of<br/>
the Chicago Convention upon the subject of slavery." (12)<br/>

sulted in a glorious triumph for the Union cause. Only a light vote, -<br/>
about six thousand, was polled, and yet the Union majority for the city<br/>
ticket will not fall far short of Fifteen Hundred, a majority that has<br/>
surprised the most sanguine of the Union men, and which is heavier than any<br/>
ever before given at a city election in which so light a vote was polled.<br/>
The Union nominees for Councilmen are also successful in at least eight<br/>
Wards, and the council will be decidedly Union. Three times three for<br/>
the glorious Forest City! Never has it done itself more honor than in<br/>
repudiating the bastard Democracy, and in opening the Presidential campaign<br/>
of 1864 with a salute for the Union whose echoes shall ring through all<br/>
the borders of the land!<br/>
"The election passed off very quietly, no disturbance of any kind taking<br/>
place at any of the places of election. In most of the wards the vote was<br/>
light, and little or no interest taker. So great was the apathy, in fact,<br/>
and such the vigor with which the Democrats worked, that it was generally<br/>
feared that the Democracy would carry the city. In view of the fact, the<br/>
triumph is even greater and proves more conclusively that the great heart<br/>
of the people still beats for Liberty and Union."<br/>

which had not reported at press time, although it was said Union nominees<br/>

<p>
590 - L. Oct. 5:4/3,8 - The grand Union rally held today, was in all respects,<br/>
a most complete and wonderful success. In spite of the rain, the city was<br/>
decorated in gala day attire. "The banner of glory and beauty floated<br/>
proudly from the flagstaff on the Square, and flags of all sizes hung from<br/>
roofs, windows, and ropes stretched across the streets." The whole city<br/>
was enthused and excited. Crowds came in trains and private conveyances<br/>
from every direction. Surrounding townships turned out in full force, East<br/>
Cleveland receiving the banner for having the largest delegation present. --<br/>
The meeting was called to order by H. M. Chapin. Judge Spaulding made a<br/>
brief speech in regard to the death of Governor Wood, who was to have pre-<br/>
sided at the meeting. Judge Day of Ravenna then made an address which he<br/>
began by reviewing the history of the secession movement. Ile spoke at<br/>
length on the Union cause and the duty of loyal men toward it. His speech<br/>
was received with much enthusiasm and applause.<br/>
The Hon. Benjamin Stanton was the next and last speaker. He spoke in<br/>
defense of the course Lincoln had taken, and showed how many things he had<br/>
thought unwise, had since been proved the very wisest measures. He defended<br/>
the emancipation proclamation and eulogized Sherman on his recent campaign.<br/>
He then showed up the weakness and absurdity of the "Chicago Platform."<br/>
Never has the city been more brilliantly illuminated. Public and private<br/>
piaces alike displayed lighted candles and lanterns. The torch-light proces-<br/>
sion of the different wards as they marched from Euclid place to the Square<br/>
was one of the finest pyrotechnic displays ever seen in Cleveland. Several<br/>
speeches were made at the evening meeting, which progressed nicely until some<br/>
"Copperhead" rowdies tried to tear down the banner and lantern hung near the<br/>
American building. Police were hurriedly called and order restored for the<br/>
remainder of the evening. º (115)<br/>

his renomination. They have therefore been industriously at work for months,<br/>

been stayed for a few weeks by the important events transpiring; but their<br/>
former malignity was not misunderstood. The integrity, purity, and ability<br/>
of the President, the universal confidence of the people, have been powerful<br/>
reasons with the opposition why he should not be renominated.<br/>
"From every quarter come the evidences that these qualities are being<br/>
appreciated and that the people are unanimously in his favor.<br/>
"From every quarter of the country where there has been any expression,<br/>
it has been overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Lincoln. The hot beds of Aboli-<br/>

gentlemen who affect to be in favor of a still more radical candidate.<br/>

in favor of Mr. Lincoln's renomination, it little becomes the mal contents<br/>
who are to meet in this city to prate about a more radical anti-slavery<br/>
policy. They can come before the Union men of the country with but<br/>
little grace and still less hope of popular approbation. Henry Ward Beecher,<br/>

to the peninsula in March 1862. When the President visited him Julv 20,<br/>
1862, he had 80,000, showing a loss of 78,500 killed, wounded, deserters,<br/>
prisoners, and discharged. This loss of men meant "defeat and disaster, a<br/>
campaign lost, the invasion of Maryland, great public gloom and discontent,<br/>
followed by Copperhead triumphs at the elections, and a general disloyal<br/>
clamor for a disunion peace." Ever since that time McClellan has stood high<br/>
in the esteem of disloyalists. This ruin "together with his pro-slavery<br/>
principles, is the secret of his immense popularity with that organization<br/>
(Copperhead)." - (6)<br/>

war, how to reconcile these conflicting views, and how to construct a<br/>

problems to be solved. -<br/>
The result was the adoption of a platform "so confused, contradic-<br/>
tory, and indefinite upon issues of peace and war that it means nothing,<br/>
and may be interpreted to mean most anything."<br/>
The platform is a weak one, and is so full of blunders that the De-<br/>

is hostility to the present administration and its desire to succeed to<br/>
the position which the administration holds. "We look for great dis- -<br/>

640 - L Sept. 3; ed:2/1 - "The unsatisfactory nature of the Platform<br/>
adopted at Chicago becomes more apparent the more closely it is examin-<br/>
ed. It was constructed with a view to getting into power, no matter at<br/>
what expense of principles, national degradation, or dishonor." The only<br/>
declaration, in the platform that indicates a definite policy is the<br/>
resolution for the cessation of hostilities, with an ultimate convention<br/>
of the states. This would give the Rebels time to prepare new supplies<br/>
and new additions to their army, while our national debt would be in-<br/>
creased. Thus by sham it is hoped that the people will be worn out and<br/>
dispirited, finally consenting to any terms offered.<br/>
"The proposition at Chicago is shameful and ought to be repudiated<br/>
by all loyal men in the land." (17)<br/>

Edward F. Noyes of the 39th Ohio regiment was introduced as the first<br/>
speaker. He touched upon the origin of the war, and distinctly proved .<br/>
that the war was commenced long before Lincoln became President. He<br/>
proceeded to picture the desolation which the madness of the South had<br/>
brought about. His eulogy and defense of Lincoln was greeted with the<br/>
wildest enthusiasm and applause. - - -<br/>
J. H. Rhodes, Esq., closed the meeting with a very vigorous and<br/>
eloquent speech, and made a powerful appeal to the people to rally in<br/>
their might at the coming election. The influence of this meeting will<br/>
be felt at the polls by an increase in the Union majority of from 800 . .<br/>
to 1,500. -- (16)<br/>

in connection with the New York soldiers' votes. In Baltimore sealed .<br/>

696 - L Nov. 1:4/3-5 - Honorable Salmon P. Chase addressed an audience at<br/>
the Union meeting held in Brainard's hall last night. He was introduced<br/>
by Judge Spaulding. He began his speech by reviewing the time when he<br/>
first came to Ohio to go to school and gives credit to the schools and<br/>
freemen of Ohio for making him what he is.<br/>
He spoke of the fact that in the midst of so great a war as this we<br/>
are able to conduct a presidential election. "It fills me with gratitude<br/>
to think that I am a citizen of a republic in which so great a spectacle<br/>
is possible."<br/>
He discussed the candidates for election and reelection and also<br/>
the conditions of the Chicago platform. Of Lincoln he said: "No one<br/>
doubts that he is sincerely and earnestly in favor of the maintenance<br/>
of the Union of the States, and that he will do all he can to preserve<br/>
the Union. The intentions of the candidates, the platform and people<br/>
of the Union party are unmistakable." -<br/>
Chase then spoke at length of the opposing party and declared that<br/>
no matter what course the Democrats pursue in order to defeat the Union<br/>
and its principles, it is a settled question in the minds of the people<br/>
that Lincoln will be reelected by a greater majority than was ever<br/>
given before in a contested election, and declared that the election of<br/>
the candidates of the opposing party is utterly hopeless.<br/>
He closed with a plea that "every man, and every woman here, may<br/>
lay to heart the importance of the great issues before us, and of their<br/>
right decision; that each may consider how far these issues reach into<br/>
time, and what immense results they will influence, and that each one<br/>
may give every energy in seeing that the last voter is brought out, for<br/>
the success of our holy cause." (62)<br/>

701 - L Nov. 3:4/3-5 - The Hon. Lyman Tremain and the Hon. Samuel -<br/>
Galloway addressed a large and enthusiastic audience that met in<br/>
Brainard's hall last night. Mr. Tremain discussed the issues involved<br/>
in the present campaign. In discussing the attitude of the people to-<br/>
ward the Rebellion, he said: "The will of our people is as fixed as<br/>
the laws of the Medes and Persians; they have resolved that this nation<br/>
shall live and this accursed rebellion shall die." He contended there<br/>
can be no right of revolution under a representative government, and we<br/>
can "right all wrongs by ballot, not by bullet."<br/>
The speaker also challenged an answer to the question, "What act of<br/>
oppression has the Federal Government ever put upon the south?" He<br/>
gave the history of Calhoun's disunion projects and measures. It has<br/>
been said that the war is a failure. This was very vigorously denied<br/>
by Mr. Tremain, who said that "it has been of unparalleled success."<br/>
He closed his remarks by saying: "We must fight this war through, wipe<br/>
out slavery, and crush the Chicago platform. We have always been<br/>
compromising with slavery; we had better settle it forever by putting<br/>
it in the grave."<br/>
Samuel Galloway commenced his speech by remarking the fact that Mr.<br/>
Tremain, formerly a Democrat, and he himself once a Whig, stood on the<br/>
same platform. He showed how the Union question had fused all parties<br/>
into one. Speaking of the war, he said that every man and woman had an<br/>
equal interest in its "great and glorious issue - the humblest soldier<br/>
as well as the President." He stated that if the Rebellion goes down,<br/>
the Union will be restored, "not the old Union, but a new and glorious<br/>
Union, robed in the attributes of God and the characteristics of an en-<br/>
lightened Christianity." He dwelt upon the fact that we were fighting<br/>
for emancipation of both races - the poor whites of the South as well<br/>
as the blacks. He referred to the historical fact that the Union was<br/>
most earnestly sought by the South and had always protected slavery.<br/>
He made very elegant closing remarks, saying: "We shall soon hear<br/>
the voice of liberty echoing and re-echoing throughout the land...."<br/>

The resignation of McClellan shows a tardy sense cf justice, as it<br/>
is two years since he was removed from command. The sense of the infamy<br/>

for him that his last public act is his best, and that being forced to<br/>

714 – L Dec. 8; ed:2/1 - The President rightly interprets the election<br/>
when he says that it "gave evidence that the people were unchanged in<br/>
their determination to stand by the Union and the Constitution. With<br/>
the exception of a few "Copperheads" the people are united in this one<br/>
thing. The Union is to be restored, by peaceful means if possible, by<br/>
war if necessary." (3)<br/>

continuous circuit, and communicating with numbered alarm boxes in<br/>
engine houses and street corners. The boxes are made of cast iron with<br/>
a knob and when tapped, signal the number of the district, thus announc-<br/>
ing the location of fire. A main office is not necessary, the boxes<br/>
being in charge of some responsible person living close bw. The cost<br/>
of this installation would not exceed $2,500, and the yearly cost would<br/>
not be more than $200. (3)<br/>

to the pursuit of raiders into neutral territory, has been revoked be-<br/>
cause of the disapproval of the President.<br/>
"Short-lived as this order has been, it has most effectually accom-<br/>
plished the cause for which it was issued. Taken in connection with<br/>
the prompt action of Congress in terminating the Reciprocity Treaty,<br/>
and in placing proper naval armament on the lakes, it has convinced<br/>
the Canadian Authorities that the Government and people of the United<br/>
States were no longer to be trifled with." (12)<br/>

has been no man on the continent of Europe better versed in the mysteries<br/>
of statecraft or more cunning by nature than the present Napoleon. -- .<br/>
"During the sixteen years he has ruled over the French nation, he has<br/>
had a definite line of policy which he has pursued with a constancy and<br/>
purpose that prove him possessed of the first qualities of genius....<br/>
His foreign policy has always had reference to strengthening the papacy<br/>
and enlarging the area of French Colonial power.... Ever since Canada<br/>
was lost to the French, it has been an object with that ambitious people<br/>
to establish a colony upon this Western continent. The rebellion offer-<br/>
ed an opportunity to carry out this dream of French conquest. Mexico<br/>
was consequently invaded, and now having been partially conquered,<br/>
Maximilian... has been transformed into Emperor Max the First.<br/>
"The question now is, what shall be the attitude of the Federal<br/>
Government toward the new Empire? There is no mistaking the issue. We<br/>
must either maintain the Monroe doctrine or back down from it until the<br/>
rebellion is over, when a hundred thousand restless soldiers of the Re-<br/>
public will take possession of Mexico, in behalf of the United States<br/>
of America.<br/>
"We are not surprised at the manner in which the organs of the<br/>
English aristocracy acquiesce in the ambitious plans of Napoleon. The<br/>
London TIMES of April 12th declares that the apology offered by the<br/>
Emperor Napoleon for invading and occupying Mexico is sufficient....<br/>
The TIMES seems especially gratified with the idea that the progress<br/>
of the Anglo-Saxon race upon this continent has been greatly impeded<br/>
by this occupation of Mexico.<br/>
"These schemes of the Emperor are no doubt aggravating, but we must<br/>
bide our time and subordinate all side issues to the suppression of the<br/>
rebellion." (12)<br/>

979 - L Aug. 2; ed: 2/1 - "There has been no better symptom of a healthy<br/>
growth of public opinion than the progress which has been made within<br/>
the few years past in the cultivation of athletic games."<br/>
The time has come when people are beginning to realize that a strong<br/>
healthy athletic body is just as important as a cultivated mind. It is<br/>
impossible for a strong mind to function properly if attached to a puny,<br/>
weak body. -<br/>
Within the past ten years much interest has been shown on the question<br/>
of making sound minds in sound bodies. Sich progress has been made, that<br/>
all schools, whether high school, academy, or college, are decidedly<br/>
behind the times without some physical education.<br/>
Ball playing is fast becoming one of the fire arts in many educational<br/>
institutions in the east. To be a good baseball or cricket player, is<br/>
to enjoy honors equal to those bestowed on a valedictorian.<br/>
Provisions should be made in Cleveland enabling women and girls to<br/>
learn swimming. "If we could have our views realized, we should have<br/>
bathing houses on the lake shore to enable all classes to learn the art<br/>
of swimming. Let us, as a people, encourage athlctic games and sports."<br/>

1035 - H July 5:3/1-4 - The Fourth of July, 1864, will be remembered in<br/>
Cleveland as being one of the most noteworthy celebrations of the<br/>
national birthday ever held within its limits. The streets were crowded<br/>
with people. The stores, with but one or two exceptions, were rigidly<br/>
closed. The procession formed early in the morning. It was composed<br/>
of the city police, the Hecker band, and the various U. S. army di-<br/>
visions. It moved through the Square, where it broke up, to be followed<br/>
by a dinner in honor of the veterans. As soon as dinner was over, the<br/>
exercises opened. George Wiley gave an able oration on the differences<br/>
between the North and the South. He defended the Northern people's<br/>
stand against slavery, and urged continuance of the war until it is<br/>
wiped out. "It is in fact a war between a higher and lower grade of<br/>
civilization.... All the great interests of civilization are pledged<br/>
to the final triumph of the soldiers of this Republic," he said. The<br/>
oration was received with frequent bursts of applause. At its conclu-<br/>
sion, Colonel Sawyer of the 8th Ohio rose and thanked the orator.<br/>
Mayor Senter presided over the proceedings and introduced the speak-<br/>
ers. Letters from the governor of Ohio and Major General Heintzelman,<br/>
apologizing for not being able to attend, were received. (79)<br/>

panies had made over one million dollars in dividends. The Continental<br/>

Fitz Hugh Ludlow, were keenly disappointed. His subject, "Good Living,"<br/>
is one which should be treated with a "biending of gravity and humor."<br/>
The lecture was a mass of incoherencies, put together without any con-<br/>
structive idea or purpose to give them unity... it was altogether unworthy<br/>
of the reputation and spirit of the man, and vastly unworthy of the sub-<br/>
ject. Ludlow, knowing he had made a failure, pleaded with the editor<br/>
to make no mention of it in the LEADER. He said he had been critically<br/>
ill only a week before and had made no preparation. "This is no excuse<br/>
however, because a man has no right to lecture on 'Good Living' when<br/>
he has nothing to offer but a mass of indigestibles." (7)<br/>

for corn, and the prices are nominal. Highwines are inactive with but<br/>
little inquiry. Prime butter is in demand and sells readily. Seeds<br/>
are dull; timothy is somewhat unsettled. The demand for flour is chief-<br/>
ly for home trade. (2)<br/>

<p>
1182 - L. May 2:4/6 - The receipts for wheat and corn for the week have<br/>
been somewhat in excess of those of the previous week. -<br/>
The wheat market has been extremely dull, heavy, and unsettled, and<br/>
though no material change has been made in prices from last week, the<br/>
tendency is toward a decline. Shippers have been holding back for a<br/>
lower market. -<br/>
Flour has been quiet during the week, the demand coming from home<br/>
trade. The sales reported do not show any changes from last week, but<br/>
the present prices of wheat hardly justify lower flour prices. Until<br/>
there is a radical decline in wheat, flour prices shall not be quoted<br/>
below present figures.<br/>
Corn has been only in moderate request, and the closing figures of<br/>
last week have been maintained.<br/>
Oats have received only a moderate inquiry, but were ruled firm from<br/>
store, a decline of l; being noted on Apr. 9. Rye and barley have<br/>
been without movement.<br/>
Provisions have been active and bouyant throughout the week, and<br/>
most articles have advanced. The market is firm.<br/>
Butter and eggs are generally quiet and prices have declined 3g on<br/>
the butter and l; on the eggs. There is a fair supply of new butter<br/>
coming in. -<br/>
Highwines have been dull all week. On Apr. 29, a panic seized the<br/>
market, in consequence of the passage by the House of Representatives<br/>
of Washburne's resolution, which calls for taxing stock on hand. Prices<br/>
dropped from $1.15 to $1.05 Q $1.07; the market closed very weak.<br/>
The grocery market is excited, as all articles have advanced, and<br/>
stocks are not large. The holders are very firm. -<br/>
Lake fish have advanced and are in good demand and firm at present<br/>
quotations. -<br/>
Most kinds of lumber have advanced, and the demand is active, with<br/>
free arrivals. Salt advanced 20g per barrel.<br/>
Petroleum, influenced by congressional action, advanced and the price<br/>
was maintained throughout the week. (10)<br/>

of its present attention. It is not shown that there is an increased<br/>

on the contrary a diminution in the regular channel. (3)<br/>

1191 - L. Aug. 1:4/6 - There was nothing done on the exchange with the<br/>
exception of the sale of red wheat on the track at $2.08. The market<br/>
closed dull and heavy, after one of the most inactive and spiritless<br/>
weeks ever known at this season of the year, when, generally, everything<br/>
is moving freely. The new wheat crop will probably start moving in the<br/>
course of a few weeks, and the old stock will have to be gotten out of<br/>
the way at some price to make room for it. Flour has been a drug on the<br/>
market for the past two weeks, with the stock large and daily increasing.<br/>
There is no material change in provisions or other leading articles, ex-<br/>

After the New York report was read at the board of trade, there was<br/>
a firmer feeling in wheat and a better demand for city and interior<br/>
millers, but nothing to show a decided improvement in price or demand,<br/>
as there was no shipping demand. Inquiries were confined to the choic-<br/>

for several days, but it must inevitably fall.<br/>
The treasury department plan for supplying gold to importers is per-<br/>

decline in the ruling rates of the past week discounted a decisive victory.<br/>

percent is explained on very different grounds however, if the rise and<br/>
fall of gold is to be regarded as controlled by the usual influences at<br/>
work.... Many foreign capitalists are speculating in our trade. The<br/>
higher gold is, the cheaper they can make their purchases. They could af-<br/>
ford to run gold much higher than it now is, for the sake of making cheaper<br/>
purchases.... Of course all inter sted in the purchase of bonds for for-<br/>
eign buyers are anxious to get gold up as high as possible. This of it-<br/>
self will explain the advance. Another fact to be remembered is that we<br/>
are on the very eve of a financial panic.... Still another cause is<br/>
found in the fact that such men as Belmont... feel that their last hope<br/>
lies in an attempt to scare the people into the idea that the re-election<br/>
of Abraham Lincoln puts off the day of Peace, and will result in the<br/>
advance in price of all things.... These three influences are enough in<br/>
themselves to explain any rise in gold that may take place for the next<br/>
three weeks. - - -<br/>

pects grow brighter every day. Every intelligent man who also knows that<br/>

1271 - L Oct. 17; ed:2/3 - The rise and fall of gold is almost entirely<br/>
governed by trickeries of gambling, instead of the laws of trade. A<br/>
visit to the New York stock exchange should be convincing enough that the<br/>
present value of gold is fictitious. "Gold gambling is a crime against<br/>
the interests of society at large, and it is absurd to suppose that a lot<br/>
of gamblers, sweating, swearing, foaming at the mouth, gnashing their<br/>
teeth, swayed by domestic fears, can properly regulate the relative value<br/>
of gold and greenbacks. The country will see it before long, when a terrible<br/>

played on the closing night of this season. Madame Ficher (or Fischer"<br/>

1345 - L. Feb. 26; ed: 2/1 - This gentleman, Mark Tapley, who persisted<br/>
in being jolly in the midst of the fevers and agues of our western<br/>
rivers, is now in Richmond, where he insists on being jollier than<br/>
ever. While a merciless conscription is being erforced, the EXAMINER<br/>
is jolly over the enthusiasm with which their armies are being filled<br/>
just as a state might be de lighied with crowds of pilgrims to the<br/>
penitentiary.<br/>
"I he terrible Yankees have not invaded North Carolina, Butler has not<br/>
captured Richmond as he wanted to, Charleston is not taken, and therefore<br/>
the rebels have great occasion to be jolly.<br/>
"Therefore, says our Richmond Mark Tapley, in a grand and overwhelm-<br/>
ing burst cf jollity in the midst of adversity, such as the world has never<br/>
seen, the affairs of the confederacy not only wear a hopeful but a<br/>
cheerful aspect.<br/>
"'Cheerful and hopeful." That is jolly, my dear Mark, just as a man's<br/>
neck in the hangman's noose is cheerful and hopeful, or as your ribs<br/>
are, just as a boa is about to hug you to death.<br/>
"Cheerful and hopeful, you Tapley of the EXAMINER, as a jolly man<br/>
ought to be with his fingers in a tightly gripping vice. Pray continue<br/>
to be jully." (6)<br/>

1353 - L Apr. 5; ed: 2/1 - The NEW NATION, a new newspaper started in<br/>
behalf of Fremont, has a Washington correspondent. Like most of the<br/>
Bohemians who write from the capital of the country, he occasionally<br/>
endeavors to render his lucubrations somewhat spicy by means of a new<br/>
sensation. This man informs the readers of the NEW NATION "that great<br/>
events are seething in Washington and are ready to burst to the light<br/>
the instant the people move." -<br/>
a<br/>
LEADER:<br/>
"The NEW NATION is quite orphic in its style. Possibly it intends<br/>
to have the public understand that the PATHF INDER is to have a grand<br/>
ovation of Congressional applause which is to come forth as an unpre-<br/>
cedented outburst! By hanging around the ante-rooms of politicians<br/>
and eavesdropping the sagacious gentlemen whom the people send to Wash-<br/>
ington as their servants, this sensational writer has discovered that<br/>
the strength of Mr. Lincoln in the country at large, is a wind bag that<br/>
needs only to be punched to collapse. After this revelation we shall<br/>
be looking for the inauguration of a punching campaign.<br/>
"In the meantime let the nation watch with all commendable diligence<br/>
until this atmospheric phenomenon shall duly take place. We should like<br/>
to see politicians properly stimulated, even unto legislative wisdom.<br/>
But we would rather forego the startling military disaster than to have<br/>
an unprecedented outbursst from Washington. The latter can be survived;<br/>
the former may prove disastrous." (11)<br/>

dead will be sad news for his many friends in this city and throughout<br/>
the northwest who knew him as one of the ablest journalists of the time.<br/>
He was one of the founders of the Republican party, and was at one time<br/>
connected editorially with the LEADER, where he proved himself a pro-<br/>

the period he was connected with the agricultural interests of the north- ‘<br/>

politics in 1860 and did good service in the cause of freedom. He was<br/>
in constant pain for several years, being a sufferer from rheumatism.<br/>

1428 - L Dec. 9:4/3,4 - Leonard P. Case, Esq., was born July 20, 1784 in<br/>
Westmore land county, Pennsylvania. He moved to Ohio in 1800 and was a<br/>
resident of Cleveland for many years. He was striken with a violent<br/>
disease in 1810, which left him a cripple for the remainder of his life.<br/>
Knowing that he never would be able to do physical labor to support him-<br/>
self, he decided to do so by his pen. His education was limited so far<br/>
as book learning was concerned, there being no schools at that time. He<br/>
learned to write and cipher however, while he was confined to his bed.<br/>
In 1806 he went to Warren where he struggled for a time with poverty, *<br/>
but felt that here he would have better chance of success. His sterling<br/>
character and common sense brought him friends who helped him in his<br/>
writing and furnished him books until he was admitted to the bar. He be-<br/>
came collector of non-resident taxes during the war of 1812 and in<br/>
1816 was appointed cashier of the Commercial bank of Lake Erie. Although<br/>
a cripple and a constant sufferer, he survived all of the original direc-<br/>
tors and officers of this bank and by early and judicious investment<br/>
in real estate, he became one of the richest men in northern Ohio. Ile<br/>
leaves one son, two brothers and three sisters. (29)<br/>

1429 - L. Jan. 25:4/3 - There are 20 oil refineries in Clevela.md employing<br/>
over 100 men. They consume 4,000 barrels of crude oil per week at a<br/>
market price of $28,000. They produce weekly 3,000 barrels of refined<br/>
oil and benzol, which has a government tax of $4 per barrel, yielding a<br/>
revenue of $624,000 a year. Crude oil is run into tanks, then piped in-<br/>
to a still and distilled. From this benzol first appears, then distil-<br/>
lates oil. The distillates are run into an agitator, where they are mixed<br/>
and stirred with sulphuric acid till they becume sweet. Finally they<br/>
are washed with water and alkalies, and placed in "bleachers" ready for<br/>

trips through the oil fields. Excitement almost to the point of insanity.<br/>
reigns in Pennyslvania, especially in Meadville, Oil City, Franklin, and<br/>
Titusville. The disease "oil on the brain" is rapidly spreading. Some<br/>
have been lucky enough to realize handsomely on their investments. This<br/>
has been the means of stimulating tens of thousands into the belief that<br/>
they will be as fortunate. Petroleum interests in Pennsylvania are passing<br/>
through a period of speculation rather than a period of development. The<br/>
oil fever rages so high that many are tempted to buy lands without seeing<br/>
or really investigating them. Land laid out in water colored drawings,<br/>
with pumps and flowing wells carefully put down at appropriate distances,<br/>
are often very different from the land in reality, but eager speculators<br/>
have often invested their money in these water colored lands, which on exam-<br/>
ination, proved to be many miles from oil-producing territories. The oil<br/>
business is in its infancy and every day new discoveries are made as good<br/>
as the old. - (33)<br/>

<p>
1439 - L Dec. 19:2/3,4 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says that the<br/>
eagerness to make money, by buying and selling of oil lands at advanced<br/>
prices, is looked upon as being detrimental by men who actually have the in-<br/>
terests of the oil trade at heart. Men are anxious to speculate by buying<br/>
and selling lands, but do not want to develop them, because selling of lards<br/>
at advanced rates is a certain source of profit, attended by none of the<br/>
risks of actual development. The maps and sketches of the oil country now<br/>
drawn are inaccurate, but a large and detailed atlas of the oil regions<br/>
will be published in January, in New York.<br/>
The oil boom has been the means of starting a new branch of business in<br/>
drafting and sketching, which is followed by a number of lawyers at various<br/>
places. In regard to investing in oil stock there are various things to be<br/>
considered. It is true that many people have made from fifty to two thou-<br/>
sand per cent on their investments, but it is also true that just as many<br/>
have lost money. (31)<br/>

1440 - L. Dec. 20:2/2, 3 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says: The oil<br/>
business in Pennsylvania has become so extensive that petroleum furnishes<br/>
a medium of exchange with foreign countries which was lost in cotton, which<br/>
was kept off the market by the rebellion. Oil already competes with the<br/>
iron and coal industry of the state. Figures show that petroleum promises<br/>
to take precedence over the iron and coal industry within the next year. It<br/>
is estimated that four or five million barrels have been produced, though up<br/>
to this time there have been no statistics to show the actual amount. (25)<br/>

<p>
1441 - L Dec. 21:2/2, 3 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says: The<br/>
character of the people in the oil regions is an unfailing subject of study.<br/>
The working population of these people is composed of yourg men. Although<br/>
much wealth has been accumulated in these regions, it is remarkable that so<br/>
few crimes have been committed. In fact, about the only scoundrels are the<br/>
legal ones.<br/>
It is much cheaper to procure oil than coal, iron, copper, lead, or gold.<br/>
Four men can put down a well in two months if they work night and day. No<br/>
department of industry offers such great rewards at so little expenditure<br/>
of labor. The boring for oil is mostly a matter of chance, and it is often<br/>
more unsuccessful than successful.<br/>
We have no confidence in the theory that oil is being manufactured spon-<br/>
taneously within the bowels of the earth. The facts prove the contrary.<br/>
The theory which regards oil as the distillate of marine plants at an age<br/>
prior to the coal formation would seem to imply that it is to be found as<br/>
wide-spread and inexhaustible as coal itself.<br/>
In certain districts, probably in the southeast border of the great sea,<br/>
where marine plants were carried by wind and water in immense quantities,<br/>
oil will be found in greater abundance than other places. This region will<br/>
be found in eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, West Virginia,<br/>
Kentucky, and Tennessee. Here is a field of enterprise that stands open to<br/>
thousands whom the war has paralyzed. By keeping clear of all manner of<br/>
sharks, and pushing the work bravely on, many a man will yet realize an<br/>
immense fortune. (44)<br/>

all last summer. Lodges were formed, arms distributed, and everything<br/>
done as before, except that the members were prohibited from talking poli-<br/>

extends all over the country and "grows bolder as the cause of the rebels<br/>
grows better." This organization, beyend a doubt, is to "defeat all<br/>
attempts of the general government to enforce the laws, and while loyal<br/>
men in the field are fighting the enemies of the Republic, loyal men at<br/>
home should maintain a constant watchfulness against all disorganizers and<br/>

1474 – L Jan. 13; ed: 1/2 - The NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW comments: "Mr.<br/>
Lincoln, as it seems to us in reviewing his career, though we have<br/>
sometimes in our impetience thought otherwise, has always waited, as a<br/>
wise man should, till the right man brings up all his reserves."<br/>
. . . The NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW should be a favorite at the White House<br/>
after this. President Lincoln "will find in some of the views which it<br/>
takes of his public course, an explanation of his official acts quite<br/>
as satisfactory, probably, as any which his own dexterity of statement "<br/>
... could furnish." - (5)<br/>

<p>
1560 – L Oct. 4; ed: 2/4 - The Democratic party at the Chicago convention<br/>
seemed thoroughly paralyzed. Had the convention declared for the one-<br/>
term principle, and in a calm and dignified way arrayed itself against<br/>
Lincoln in favor of Generals Dix or Sherman, "it might have struck the<br/>
keynote of popular sympathy, and swept away every vote in the electoral<br/>
college. But lured by our despondency and confident of triumph it<br/>
followed the evil counsels of Wallandigham, Powell and Pendleton - it<br/>
declared the war a failure, and spoke for peace at any price."<br/>
McClellan's letter to acceptance, exhibits the best side of the<br/>
Democracy. It says: "The Union is the one condition of peace." If hy<br/>
peace he does not mean restoration, he means nothing at all. If he does<br/>
mean restoration, he makes the laying down of arms and the return to<br/>
allegiance its only condition. An armistice between belligerents must<br/>
be entered into by the highest authorities on either side. Not until<br/>
the leaders of the Confederacy are dethroned, inquisition crushed, and<br/>
the shackles removed from the people's limbs and lips by federal arms,<br/>
will the masses learn to see and act for themselves and return to their<br/>
old and true allegiance. (22)<br/>

hold together to insure them triumph and a speedy return of Peace." (8)<br/>

Sept. 10 by the Democrats. A small crowd of "Copperheads" attended.<br/>
"Of its soundness on all Copperhead principles there could be no doubt,<br/>
from the cheering at every argument for peace, and every sneer for the<br/>
'nigger' soldiers." The "Temperance" band was there, and being more<br/>
loyal than the crowd, played "The Star Spangled Banner" and "The Red<br/>
White and Blue."<br/>
The meeting was opened by a series of resolutions which started with<br/>
a denunciation of the present administration, and declared that their<br/>
only hope lies in a change of administration. Another resolution de-<br/>
clared that the object of the war sluould be the "Union as it was and<br/>

1563 - L. Sept. 19; ed:2/1 - August Belmont, chairman of the "Copperhead"<br/>
national executive committee of the Democratic party, is an Austrian<br/>
Jew, and a financial agent of the well-known house of Rothschild in<br/>
Europe, which holds Confederate bonds purchased for almost nothing.<br/>
This committee is endeavoring, through Belmont, to bring about a ces-<br/>
sation of hostilities based upon granting everything asked for by the<br/>
South. It wants the national government to assume the Confederate<br/>
debt, which will add much to the already fabulous wealth of that great<br/>
house by increasing the value of its bonds.<br/>
"The Rothschilds know that the re-election of Lincoln will result in<br/>
the suppression of the rebellion and the worthlessness of confederate<br/>
bonds. It remains to be seen what success these foreign Shylocks will<br/>
meet." (6)<br/>

1568 - L Oct. 14; ed: 2/1 - Anyone taking the trouble to compare the<br/>

the "rebels through the instrumentality of armed rebellion," will dis-<br/>
cover that the "doctrines avowed at Chicago are such as the rebels them-<br/>
selves have no trouble in affirming with gun and bayonet."<br/>
The Rebels and the "Copperheads" agree in their views on the way in<br/>
which the subject of exchanging prisoners was treated, and declare that<br/>
the government should abandon its black soldiers to whatever fate the<br/>
Rebels see fit to impose upon them. They both agree that it was cruel to<br/>
arm the black men and insist upon making an exchange without reference to<br/>
negro soldiers. -<br/>
"The doctrines enunciated in the form of resolutions at Chicago might<br/>
result in active co-operation with the South. The logical sequence of the<br/>

cheering ceased, Payne congratulated the crowd on the mighty reduction<br/>
of the "Abolition" majorities, and said that one more such victory as<br/>
that of the late election would lay the Abolitionists at the feet of<br/>
the Democrats. He also told them that they must not relax until McClellan<br/>

1583 - L June 1; ed:2/2-4; 4/3-5 - "Yesterday... was a great day for<br/>
politicians. It was the day in which (vide the New York WORLD and -<br/>
HERALD, the Chicago TiMES and the Cincinnati ENQUIRER), the greatest<br/>
political movement of modern times was to be set on foot, a new party<br/>
be formed, and the next President nominated - a day more fatal to<br/>
Abraham Lincoln than the Ides of March to Caesar. -- -<br/>
"The day certainly passed off with most remarkable quiet. Besides<br/>
the arrivals chronicled yesterday, but few made their appearance, and<br/>
the convention, for one so widely heralded and anxiously prepared for,<br/>
was singularly small in numbers and weak in talent."<br/>
The convention inet at eleven o'clock at Chapin's hall. "The two<br/>
thousand delegates from Missouri have not been heard from. It is sup-<br/>
posed that they stopped at Cincinnati for consultation with the proprietor -<br/>
of the ENQUIRER as to the best mode of defeating Lincoln. The two<br/>
thousand from New York were similarly missing, and the convention was<br/>
in numbers a very slim affair....<br/>
"There was also a 'most pleasant lack' of leaders in the convention.<br/>
Horace Greeley... was absent, and his absence was regretted by delegates<br/>
even more than that of the masses. B. Gratz Brown was also unaccountably<br/>
missing, and the convention felt the loss of his active and commanding<br/>
intellect. -<br/>
"From the first it was evident that there was a secret, but<br/>

irrepressible conflict between the friends of General Grant, including<br/>
most of the New York delegation and many from the Eastern States, who<br/>
were mainly of Democratic antecedents, and those of General Fremont,<br/>
composed mainly of the old abolitionists and the radical Germans,<br/>
and led by Coionel Moss, of Missouri."<br/>
E. Gilbert, president of the New York "Fremont" club, called the<br/>
convention to order and immediately nominated ex-Governor Johnston of<br/>
Pennsylvania as temporary chairman. Johnston was elected by acclama-<br/>
tion. B. H. Brooks of California and S. Wolf of Washington were<br/>
chosen secretaries. A committee on permanent organization, of ten<br/>
members, was appointed.<br/>
The number of delegates attending the convention was so small that<br/>
the committee appointed to enroll their names never made its report.<br/>
"We believe, however, that there were about one hundred and fifty dele-<br/>
gates present, of whom nearly half were from Missouri and wild for<br/>
Fremont, and ihe others mainly from New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois."<br/>
In addressing the convention, General Cochrane said, in part: "You<br/>
assemble here intending to support the army in the field, and at the<br/>
same time to organize a great civil army to fight for principles, and<br/>
to save for all generations the precious legacy obtained for us by the<br/>
sacrifices of the soldiers of the Union. The rebellion, it must be<br/>
suppressed; the Union, it must be preserved."<br/>
The nomination of Grant "was very faintly cheerei, and it was evident<br/>
that the name of the hero of Spottsylvania would pale before that of<br/>
the swordless general of New York.<br/>
"Nothing would do however, for the St. Louis Germans, who voted not<br/>
to recognize God's hand in war, but to nominate Fremont.<br/>
"General Fremont was nominated by acclamation.<br/>
"The 3,000 delegates, with whom the city was said to swarm yesterday<br/>
by the imaginative PLAIN DEALER, cheered heartily over the good work."<br/>
General Cochrane was nominated by acclamation for vice president. The<br/>
naming of the party was deferred until night when a committee, appointed<br/>
in the afternoon, reported the name of the new party to be the Radical<br/>
Democracy. Bird B. Chapman represented Ohio on the executive committee,<br/>
consisting of 15 members. (128)<br/>

<p>
1584 – L June 2; ed:2/1 - The "Fremont" convention held here May 31 was<br/>
given wide publicity by the Democratic press throughout the country, but<br/>
its slimness and insignificance was a surprise even to those who knew how<br/>
feeble the whole affair would be.<br/>
The authorized delegates present did not exceed 200. Of the six<br/>
or eight individuals who manipulated the convention only General Cochrane<br/>
of New York was f any national prominence. -<br/>
The state of Missouri, in which a rabid red Republicanism finds ex-<br/>
istence, virtually controlled the convention.<br/>
The object of the convention, aside from gratifying a spite toward<br/>
President Lincoln, was to affirm a more radical policy than any yet<br/>
enunciated, and to put forward a man who will carry the policy into<br/>
effect.<br/>
Mr. Foster, the special champion of radical views, was obliged to<br/>
confess in his speech Tuesday (May 29) that the Republican party holds<br/>
the same views on the subject of slavery as expressed in the Fremont<br/>
platform.<br/>
The doctrines laid down in the Fremont platform, those that are<br/>
vital, will all be substantially affirmed at Baltimore, (the Republican<br/>
convention.) Their realization will be much sooner attained by a strict<br/>
unity of the Union party, than by such a disorganizing scheme as the<br/>
one inaugurated in Cleveland.<br/>
"We have commented thus at length, not from any apprehension, ...<br/>
but from the conviction that the Copperheads... will endeavor to fan the<br/>
whole affair into importance.<br/>
"The Convention, in a word, was made up of oily politicians from<br/>
New York, impetuous, hair-brained Germans from St. Louis, several<br/>
venerable abolitionists... together with an admixture of personal friends<br/>
and parasites of Fremont, all controlled by one feeling - that of hatred<br/>
for Abraham Lincoln." - - (18)<br/>

1602 - L. May 19:2/3, 4 - W. H. Upson of Summit county and D. R. Tilden of<br/>
Cleveland were renominated as delegates to the Baltimore National Union<br/>
committee yesterday at the convention of the 28th congressional district<br/>
Abstract 1602<br/>
POLITICAL PARTIES - Union (Cont'd)<br/>
held in Brainard's hall. The only other candidate for delegate was<br/>
Senator Williamson.<br/>
Senator Williamson was not at the convention. When he was called upon<br/>
to express his opinion on a candidate for the presidency, William Fuller<br/>
spoke in his behalf, stating his understanding of Mr. Williamson's position<br/>
to be that he is in favor of the nomination of Mr. Lincoln, but would not<br/>
pledge himself to continue voting for him if circumstances should show<br/>
some other man to be a stronger candidate.<br/>
Judge S. II. Pitkin explained Mr. Upson's unavoidable absence from the<br/>
convention and stated that he was for Mr. Lincoln, first, last, and all<br/>
the time, but that he would support the nominee of the convention.<br/>
Judge Tilden was the only candidate for delegate who addressed the<br/>
convention.<br/>
He said he was very free to state his preferences on the question of<br/>
support. He said be had no desire to go to Baltimore, and had no idea of<br/>
going without clearly defining his position and knowing that it represented<br/>
the views of a majority of the convention. He declared himself in favor of<br/>
the nomination of Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Tilden lad opposed Mr. Lincoln's<br/>
nomination at Chicago, but said he had since watched his course carefully<br/>
and believed him to be as pure a man as had ever held the administration<br/>
of a government in his hands.<br/>
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Tilden added, "by his course, his calmness, his far-<br/>
sightedness," had fused and arrayed all parties against the mightiest cf<br/>
rebellions.<br/>
Judge Barr enquired if Judge Tilden would abide by the nomination of the<br/>
Baltimore convention, and made a reference to the convention of 1848, which<br/>
nominated General Taylor.<br/>
Judge Tilden explained his course at that convention in full, and<br/>
admitted that in obedience to the instructions of the convention which<br/>
nominated him, he did make an ass of himself and bolt the ticket, voting<br/>
for Mr. Wan Buren.<br/>
Seth A. Marshall, Lake county, was nominated by acclamation as pre-<br/>
sidential elector for the district. Peter Thatcher, jr., was chosen as<br/>
alternate delegate for Judge Tilden. John Johnston, Summit county, was<br/>
unanimously elected the alternate of Mr. Upson.<br/>
"The following resulution, offered by the Hon. John Crowell, was adopted<br/>
with overwhelming unanimity:<br/>
"That this convention has undiminished confidence in the wisdom and<br/>
patriotism of President Lincoln and his administration, and that the people<br/>
demand his renomination at the Baltimore convention."<br/>
Permanent organization of the conver,tion was affected when a committee<br/>
report naming H. S. Stevens of Cuyahoga, president, was adopted. Vice<br/>
presidents of the convention were Theodore Brock, Cuyahoga county; Simeon<br/>
Perkins, Summit county; and John Murray, Lake county. Secretaries were:<br/>
J. C. Grannis, Cuyahoga county; W. W. Nevison, Lake County; and E. P. Green,<br/>
Summit county. (36)<br/>

co-operate in their efforts to suppress the Rebellion.<br/>
It is predicted that 14 of the 19 districts of Ohio will elect Union<br/>
representatives at the coming election. Let not a single effort be spared<br/>

former defenders becoming its bitterest enemies. It also says "that<br/>
if the Union can be restored this metaphysical opinion of the South<br/>
would ultimately, by reason of self interest, die out in the South."<br/>
(LEADER) "This is all a very nice bit of reasoning, but it is un-<br/>
sound in starting with the assumption that the Union could be restored<br/>
and the virtual independence of rebel States be recognized before a<br/>
convention of States was called. A convention of States predicated<br/>
upon an admission of the right of any State to secede and consequent<br/>
justification of the rebellion, never could result in restoration of<br/>
the Union except on such terms as the rebels might see fit to dictate<br/>
as conditions of their return. The recognition of the right of a State<br/>

Kentucky provides that slaves cannot be freed without their owner's<br/>

hoiders are urged, therefore, to signify their desire for the emanci-<br/>

A clause in the constitution requiring deportation of slaves from<br/>

1681 - L. Feb. 19; ed: 2/1, 2 - Popular sentiment in favor of the continu-<br/>
ance of Lincoln in office until the Rebellion has ended, has alarmed<br/>
political gamblers throughout the country. They have commenced the work<br/>
of vilifying the President and his administration.<br/>
"When the attempt is made to forestall the choice of the people it<br/>
is well that the people should be forewarned." (6)<br/>

1682 - L. Mar. 26; ed: 2/1 - Mr. Pendleton has introduced a bill to give<br/>
cabinet officers a seat in the House.<br/>
Difficulties might arise from giving cabinet members a place on the<br/>
floor to explain or defend their policy, since such an arrangement<br/>
would give free play to the inquisition of representatives. But after<br/>
giving all objections the importance due them, there are strong reasons<br/>
why Mr. Pendleton's bill should prevail.<br/>
Such a measure would reduce executive influence by making it more<br/>
directly accountable... every cabinet officer would be more careful<br/>
if his policy were subject to such inspection... it would be impossi-<br/>
ble to conceal fraud or treason, as was done during the reign of Mr.<br/>
Buchanan. (8)<br/>

<p>
1739 - L Dec. 8; ed: 2/2 - "The large number of accidents which have oc-<br/>
curred lately, both East and West, have caused considerable comment on<br/>
the defects of American railways."<br/>
One critic says: "The chief defects of many railways is insufficient<br/>
ballasting of the road. Another defect is the poor, cheap iron purchased<br/>
by some roads. The method of fastening rails to the sleepers is<br/>
often defective, spikes becoming loose and often can be pulled out with<br/>
the fingers. Bolts or wood screws should be used. India rubber springs<br/>
on freight cars are considered dangerous because of the hammering they<br/>
produce, but hammering would be greatly reduced by good springs that<br/>
would ease the weight from a sudden blow or jolt. The mean and illegal<br/>
spirit prevents many companies from first making good roads, and then<br/>
keeping their bad ones in repair." (10)<br/>

1740 – H Dec. 27; ed: 2/3 - "The responsibility resting, at all times,<br/>
upon railroad managers is neither light nor enviable; at this time such<br/>
responsibility is ponderous. Our roads are reaching the end of their<br/>
first life; most of them were not substantially built and hence have<br/>
early come to decreptitude. These evils could easily be remedied were<br/>
it not the misfortune of the colupanies, just now, to have thrown upon<br/>
their tracks an amount of business they are inadequate, properly and<br/>
safely, to carry. Cold weather, too, ... aggravates terribly the dangers<br/>
of rail transit." (11)<br/>

1778 - L. Aug. 8; ed:2/2 - Supporters of the government protest the Presi-<br/>

belongs to the legislative department rather than to the executive. They<br/>
denounce the President's plan as arbitrary, ambitious, and usurping powers<br/>

belongs to Congress and not to the President, although we have regarded<br/>
him fully authorized to provide for restoration to the Union of such<br/>
States as have come under our military sway. We are in favor of Peace<br/>
and the restoration of the Union. Let the law of re-admission be de-<br/>

1779 - L. Sept. 28:2/1 - Seperate state action is getting to be a favor-<br/>
ite doctrine in many quarters of the South, and if a state treats for<br/>
peace as a sovereign state she withdraws from the Confederacy. Rebel<br/>
leaders who still cherish hope of success through the overthrow of the<br/>
present administration look with alarm upon the movement calculated to<br/>
work their speedy overthrow which is now started.<br/>
"It cannot be doubted that if there be such a movement in the State<br/>
of Georgia, sustained by men of positions and numbers who wish to bring<br/>
back Georgia to her allegiance, that a magnanimous course will be adopted<br/>
by the Government of the United States in order to win her away from<br/>
the wicked rebellion.<br/>
"If now she will see fit, having repented of her sins and lamented<br/>
her wicked folly, to return to her allegiance, she can have peace. The<br/>
Government will put no obstructions in the way of an immediate return.<br/>
Georgia cuts the Confederacy in twain and makes it impossible for a re-<br/>
construction of the remaining fragments." (11)<br/>

1833 - L Apr. 1:4/6 - Messrs. Quayle and Martin launched a bark at their<br/>
yards yesterday afternoon for Cunningham, Shaw, and Company of Liverpool.<br/>
The ship was designed to form one of the lines operated by this firm be-<br/>
tween Liverpool and the Great Lakes. She is called the THERMUTIS, ard<br/>
though not of the largest size, is one of the staunchest vessels ever<br/>
turned out by our builders. She will be wire-rigged. As soon as com-<br/>
pleted she will clear for Liverpool, where she will receive her register<br/>
and commission, preparatory to taking her place in the line.<br/>
We believe this vessel is the first launched from a western shipyard<br/>
for a foreign account, and we feel proud to be able to claim this distinc-<br/>
tion for our enterprising shipbuilders. -<br/>
The THERMUTIS is 142 feet long over-all, with a keel length of 137 feet.<br/>
Her beam is 26 feet, her hold, 12-1/2 feet, and burthen, 420 tons.<br/>
The business of our shipbuilders this season has been large, and the<br/>
vessels contracted for of the best class, continued proof of the high<br/>
estimate in which our builders are held.<br/>
Peck, and Masters are now building three propellers for Dean Richmond<br/>
to run in connection with the New York Central railroad. They will be<br/>
ready for the spring trade. . . . . -<br/>
' ' ' The DEAN RICHMOND, one of the finest ships of her kind on the Great<br/>
Lakes, was recently launched for N. C. and II. J. and II. J. Winslow by<br/>
Quayle and Martin and is now receiving her boilers at the Cuyahoga works.<br/>
She will see service in the Buffalo-Chicago line. This firm is also en-<br/>
gaged in building a propeller for Capt. Edward Turner.<br/>
Loffrimier has nearly completed a fine propeller for Robert Hanra and<br/>
Company, to run in the Lake Superior line.<br/>
Presley and Stevens bave rebuilt the Northern Transportation co's pro-<br/>
peller YOUNG AMERICA, adding several feet to her length, and making other<br/>
important improvements. - -<br/>
Several tugs are being constructed for various parties, and T. W.<br/>
Kennard of the Atlantic and Great Western railroad is having a magnifi-<br/>
cent steel yacht built by Peck and Masters. (7)<br/>

<p>
1840 - L. May 24:4/5 - The chief interest in navigation has been trans-<br/>
ferred from the shipyards to the harbor, most of the new vessels having<br/>
been launched.<br/>
A splendid yacht for T. W. Kennard, Esq., is being built by Peck and<br/>
Masters, and a propeller called IRONSIDES is being built by Quayle and<br/>
Martin. The Kennard yacht is 44 feet long. Her beam is 25 feet, the<br/>
depth of the hold, 14 feet and the tonnage, 500 tons. She is really a<br/>
small ocean steamer built for swiftness of sailing and comfort of pas-<br/>
sengers. Mr. Kennard has given orders that the boat shall be built of<br/>
western material and by western labor. Her furniture will be costly and<br/>
luxurious. At the end of the season the boat will be taken to New York<br/>
in readiness for a trip to England at the beginning of the next season.<br/>
The dimensions of the propeller IRONSIDES are as follows: Length, 233<br/>
feet; beam, 31 feet, and depth of hold, 13-1/2 feet. She is being built for<br/>
Lake Superior passenger trade. Her engines, two low pressure cylinders,<br/>
34 by 46 inches, are from the Cuyahoga works. She will have three foot<br/>
guards, and her cabins will be 210 feet long and 14 feet wide. Her speed<br/>
is expected to be 16 miles an hour. (10)<br/>

<p>
1841 - L. July 8:4/3 - The propeller LAC LA BELLE is a beautiful boat and<br/>
has all the modern conveniences. A high rate of speed was obtained yes-<br/>
terday in her trial run.<br/>
The boat is 225 feet long, with a beam of 31 feet seven inches. Her<br/>
hold is 13 feet deep and her tonnage is 872 tons. The boat's draught is<br/>
nine feet aft and four feet eight inches forward. There are spacious<br/>
pantry and cook rooms, and a smoking room with facilities for washing.<br/>
The total number of engines is five. The main engines are of the con-<br/>
densing type, with a 44-inch bore and a 34-inch stroke. There are two<br/>
separate boilers and smoke stacks. The design of the entire machinery is<br/>
simple, yet evinces a correctness of proportion, a regard for taste, and<br/>
an arrangement of detail complimentary to her designer, J. F. Holloway,<br/>
and the builder, the Cuyahoga works.<br/>
The hoisting engines are 12 by 12, high pressure. These are connect-<br/>
ed with a line of shafting, running the entire length of the boat, and<br/>
are used for discharging the cargo as well as working extra bilge pumps<br/>
in case of necessity. The boºt is also supplied with a steam duplex<br/>
Westinghouse pump, used for filling the boilers in port, or when the main<br/>
engines are stopped, and also, by means of pipe and hose, to throw water<br/>
on all parts of the boat in case of fire. -<br/>
"Probably no boat yet built is so well provided against any accident<br/>
from leakage or fire as this one is."<br/>
Painting of the boat was done most excellently by R. L. Willard. The<br/>
upholstery ard carpeting was supplied by T. S. Beckwith and company, and<br/>
the furniture by William Hart.<br/>
The boat will be commanded by Capt. John Spalding, formerly with the<br/>
NORTHERN LIGHT. - - (19)<br/>

1965 - L. Mar. 8:4/3, 4 - In a speech at the Sanitary fair, Miss Dickinson<br/>
referred to a story of the black man at Rodmans Point, who, when a boat<br/>
was stuck fast and swept by Rebel bullets, coolly got up and pushed it<br/>
off, remarking: "Somebody must die to get out of this and it might as<br/>
well be I." Above all groans, l;atred and sighs comes the voice of a<br/>
down-trodden people saying: "Somebody must die to get us out of this<br/>
and it might as well be we."<br/>
When she compared the Breckenridge Democrats in New York as fit<br/>
associates for robbers in the South, several people got up and walked<br/>
out, whereupon the speaker remarked; "Thats right, run away from the<br/>
truth you can't stand." (43)<br/>

<p>
2127 – L Nov. 30:4/3 - The sensational drama, WAITING FOR THE WERDICT,<br/>
was presented to the largest audience of the season last night. This play<br/>
has recently had a successful run in the east. It is domestic in character<br/>
and appeals to those deep quiet sympathies which are common to all. The<br/>
play is full of startling incidents; the elements are so varied that nothing<br/>
in the way of stimulus is wanting. In the way of criticism, some things<br/>
foreign and unnecessary were added which would have been better left out.<br/>
The rendition was admirable, and Mr. Buchanan as the old farmer was excellent<br/>
throughout. Virginia Buchanan as the wife of the innocent convict failed<br/>
at times to put depth and feeling in her expression. The play, all in all,<br/>
was admirably delivered. (8)<br/>

2128 - L. Dec. 21:4/3 - The great spectacular drama, ALADDIN, produced<br/>
for the first time in many years at the Academy of Music, was very success-<br/>
ful. The audience was more enthusiastic over it than a Clevelard audience<br/>
has ever been over any other play. Mr. Ellsler as the dumb slave, "Kasrac,"<br/>
exhibited pantomimic power that might be ranked in the first order of comedy<br/>
acting. The piece contains the unique and original Chinese umbrella dance.<br/>

man who has not indulged in vaticinations. Mr. Seward is a remarkable<br/>

day prognostications of thirty months ago.<br/>
"No doubt the Confederacy has received some staggering blows in the<br/>
campaign just closed, but that there is any evidence that its strength<br/>

"We are confident that the war can be ended in one more campaign, but<br/>
not by starvation, not by a degenerated currency, not by an "amnesty," -<br/>
but by the armies of Meade and Foster, Grant and Banks. We should not be<br/>
thus pointed in our strictures, did we not see danger to the Republic in<br/>

cease prognosticating; fill the regiments and hurl them once more upon<br/>

2260 - L. Feb. 12; ed:2/2 - Legoyt, chief of the statistical bureau of<br/>
the French ministry of agriculture, commerce, and public works, reports<br/>
on the strength of the armies of Europe. The report says: "In a time<br/>
of profound peace this strength is 3,875,847 men, nearly equal to the<br/>
whole population of the state of New York." Legoyt indulges in reflec-<br/>
tion as to the "disarming of one-half" of each army. 1,907,924 men,<br/>
between the ages of 20 and 35, are restored to labors of peace, and at<br/>
once a saving of $32,000,000 is affected. This amount can be used to<br/>
extend railroads, establish more schools, or reduce taxes. This would<br/>
mean a great deal to the people of Europe. Two million men would be re-<br/>
stored to the arts of peace and rates of labor would be reduced. It<br/>
would preserve family bonds, broken because of absence.<br/>
"It is to prevent just such a condition as this, that the American<br/>
people have been plunged into this bloody war....<br/>
"The southern slave lords would like to imitate the 'baker's dozen'<br/>
plan by which Europe is governed. This vast system by which men are<br/>
dragooned into submission, will receive its death blow in the triumph of<br/>
our arms." (15)<br/>

2287 - L. Aug. 16; ed:2/1 - "Though war is a scourge of the most bitter<br/>
character, and though there follow in its train ten thousard evils and<br/>
vices, it yet has its influence for good, in moulding the spirit of a<br/>
great nation."<br/>
History shows that a nation is never the same after a great war.<br/>
People change souially and politically, and occupy different positions<br/>
toward other nations. War sometimes degrades or lowers haughty nations<br/>
to the level of inferior powers, and again it elevates to a lofty posi-<br/>
tion a small and gallant nation with resources of unexpected richness,<br/>
an example being our own country. One change is the interest shown by<br/>
European countries towards us. Before the revolution they scarcely gave<br/>
our republic a thought as to consulting the United States about making<br/>
changes in European affairs. Things are changed now, and hereafter.<br/>
"The views entertained by the Republic on 'balance of power' must be<br/>
entitled to great consideration."<br/>
Another change brought about by the war is the social change. There's<br/>
a more unequal distribution of property than has hitherto existed in<br/>
this country and there must, therefore, be such a change in the affairs<br/>
of the people as corresponds to this new financial condition.<br/>
Another result of the war will be the selection as candidates for<br/>
offices of military men who are accustomed to the stern government of the<br/>
army and will, therefore, modify the political status of the country.<br/>
"We are entering upon a new stage of being, and will not be the same<br/>
people hereafter, that we have been heretofore." (18)<br/>

"Webster made no such remarks, and to publish such a piece of lying<br/>
nonsense is a vile slander upon the memory of that great man."<br/>
Events that occurred before the inauguration of Lincoln show that<br/>

not sufficient cause for Rebellion.<br/>
The leading traitors of the South had been trying to organize and<br/>
consummate secession as completely as possible before the inauguration<br/>
of the new President, and the Rebels would not have seceded if the<br/>
Republican party had agreed to throw open the territories to slavery,<br/>

had elected Lincoln.<br/>

placed at the head of the armies this plan was abandoned, and Union<br/>
forces massed against points of vital importance to the Rebellion. The<br/>
result has been that the Rebels have been out-numbered in all the major<br/>

for the memory of its departed members.<br/>
A committee cf five was appointed to receive the remains of the dead<br/>
soldiers, among the members being Judge J. P. Bishop, N. B. Sherwin,<br/>
and W. C. McFarland.<br/>
Judge Bishop, in his adāress on the death of Captain Philpot, said:<br/>
"Knowing him as I do, I can bear testimony to his uniform, correct habits<br/>
and integrity. Though apparently diffident, when responsibility de-<br/>
volved upon him he never shrank from it, but performed it with unwonted<br/>
firmness and integrity. -<br/>
"It was the discovery of this trait of character that caused me to<br/>
advise him to enter the service of the country, and do what he could to<br/>
aid in the suppression of the rebellion."<br/>
W. C. McFarland spoke principally about Captain Hutchinson, saying,<br/>
"I was well and 1ntimately acquainted with him. He was my classmate in<br/>
law school. In my judgment his was not one of those great overshadowing<br/>
minds which so readily grasp the philosophy, and dive deep into the<br/>
bowels of the law, but he was a man of ordinary capacity, with remarkable<br/>
industry." (52)<br/>

the battle front, a thousand strong. After many heroic battles this<br/>
celebrated regiment, now scarcely 200 strong, came back today.<br/>
Fire bells and clanging of all kinds announced their arrival at "-<br/>
seven o'clock at the depot. People arrived by the thousands; mothers<br/>
and sons, brothers and sisters met them with great joy. • * ~ *<br/>

filed around to where the tables were spread and had breakfast; then<br/>
they marched up to the square. Crowds of people and flags were every-<br/>
where.<br/>
J. C. Grannis, city attorney, spoke as follows: "You, and those who<br/>
went with you, whether present here today, or absent, whether among the<br/>
living, or the dead, shall be forever after held in grateful remembrance."<br/>
Governor Brough said: "You have been in a school and under a dis-<br/>
cipline which has taught you many things. You have learned one thing<br/>
amid the carnage of battle - that there are but two alternatives left<br/>
us - the one a base and cowardly submission, the other, to break the<br/>
power of the southern states. We must gain our peace by craven sub-<br/>
mission, or by annihilating the armies of the South." The reception<br/>
over, the regiment filed to Camp Cleveland. (48)<br/>

<p>
2348 - L. Sept. 21; ed:2/1 - "It is astonishing, that, notwithstanding<br/>
the terrible evils which the rebellion has brought upon the South, the<br/>
Rebel leaders have been able to hold in an iron grip the armies which<br/>
they have organized." The reason for this is that while the rank and<br/>
file of the Southern army have physical courage, they lack moral cour-<br/>
age to rebel against their leaders. So long as the Rebel armies are<br/>
unbroken the villains are capable of wielding such a despotism as is<br/>
unknown in any other part of the globe. If they are deprived of their<br/>
power and are left to the mercies of a cruelly outraged South they<br/>
will have no resting place for their feet on this continent.<br/>
"Let there be no negotiation with the Rebel leaders, but let them<br/>
be dealt with all the energy of force until their power is destroyed."<br/>

<p>
2349 - L Nov. 11; ed: 2/2 - The war has made many changes in the condition<br/>
of the Rebel and the Union armies. The Rebels had the advantage in the<br/>
beginning, due to the fact that many young men who had attended military<br/>
schools in the South were ready to take command of their troops. Many<br/>
officers who were considered to be the best became identified with the<br/>
Rebellion. These advantages were at first noticeable in the superior<br/>
discipline of Rebel soldiers when brought in contact with the raw<br/>
recruits of the North. However, years of war changed these conditions.<br/>
The Rebel soldiers became an undisciplined, thieving, and disorganized<br/>
army, more dangerous to the South than to the Northern armies.<br/>
"It is so long since the Rebels have had a great victory, that they<br/>
have become habituated to defeat, and will grow more and more so as the<br/>
pressure of our armies continues.... We have the men, means and money,<br/>
and now that the people have triumphantly re-elected Abraham Lincoln,<br/>
the day cannot be very far hence when the Rebellion must utterly cease<br/>
from the land." (10)<br/>

<p>
2350 - L. Feb. 3; ed: 2/2, 6 - In his Congressional speech on confiscation<br/>
of Confederate property, the Ilon. James A. Garfield declared that such<br/>
confiscation was justified by the action of the South. He said in part:<br/>
"When the government of the United States declared that we were in<br/>
a state of war, the rebel states came under the laws of war. By their<br/>
acts of rebellion they swept away every vestige of their civil and polit-<br/>
ical rights under the constitution of the United States. Their obli-<br/>
gations still remained, but the reciprocal rights which usually accompany<br/>
obligations, they had forfeited.<br/>
"The question then lies open before us: In a state of war, is this<br/>
resolution legal and politic?<br/>
"I remember to have said to a friend when I entered the army, 'You<br/>
hate slavery; so do I; but I hate disunion more. Let us drop the<br/>
slavery question and fight to sustain the Union."<br/>
"Mr. Speaker, I am surprised and amazed beyond measure at what I have<br/>
seen in this House. Having been so long with men who had but one<br/>
thought upon these great themes, it is passing strange to me to hear<br/>
men talking of the old discussions of a few years ago. They forget<br/>
that a nation sometimes may live a generation into a single year and<br/>
the experience of the last three years has been greater than that of<br/>
centuries of peace and quiet.<br/>
"If we want peace that is not a hollow peace, we must make thorough<br/>
work of this war. We must establish freedom in the midst of servitude,<br/>
and the authority of law in the midst of rebellion. We must fill the<br/>
ranks of our armies, assure them that a grateful and loving people are<br/>
behind them and they will go down against the enemy bearing with them<br/>
the majesty and might of a great nation.<br/>
"The war began by proclamation and it must end by proclamation."<br/>
Mr. Garfield's speech cuts so directly down to the heart of the whole<br/>
question of confiscation that our readers will be glad to read it. It<br/>
has been spoken of as the most effective speech made in Congress this<br/>
session." (106)<br/>

2408 – L June 28; ed:2/1 - A very important debate occurred in the house<br/>
of lords, in which the question of federal recruiting was discussed. The<br/>
opponents of the government made a violent effort to prove that the con-<br/>
tinuation of the war is wholly due to the fact that foreigners, especially<br/>
the subjects of the queen, are enlisted into the federal army. The Marquis<br/>
of Clauricade made the statement that "if the proper measures had been<br/>
taken to prevent it long ago, the civil war in America would have ended<br/>
before now; and if the recruiting of British subjects were now put a stop<br/>
to," he believed the war would be brought to an early end.<br/>
"From these features of the discussion it is also clear that tile question<br/>
of intervention is liable to come up in a new phase before long.<br/>
"Success of our armies can alone prevent it. Every energy should there-<br/>
fore be put forth to accomplish the work to be done, this summer." (10)<br/>

These serving one year to receive $200; two years, $300; three years,<br/>

<p>
2428 – H Aug. 5: 1/5 - Yesterday, two contrabands were being taken to Buffalo<br/>
by-some "broker" who offered them $50 to enlist in the army. Some colored<br/>
men on the train heard of the swindle, and persuaded the contrabands to<br/>
stop off here, where they could get $300 or $400. The broker objected, and<br/>
a fight started. Two men were jailed, and the contrabands locked up for<br/>
safe keeping. - * - (3)<br/>

2429 - H Aug. 5; ed: 1/2 - To fill the quota in New York city, which is<br/>
19,000 under the half million call, the bounty has been raised from $325<br/>
to $600, making the sum necessary to get the recruits $11,400,000.<br/>
"It looks like a pretty big burden, but it is really nothing to the<br/>
rich comiuercial center. Half a score of the merchant princes could raise<br/>
the sum in an hour. Will they stand this test of their patriotism?" (2)<br/>

<p>
2430 - L. Aug. 15; ed: 2/1 - Immediately upon the call for 500,000 men and<br/>
the passage of a bill permitting recruiting in Rebel states, much anxiety<br/>
was manifested to fill up quotas by the use of money amongst Negroes of<br/>
disloyal states. Agents from the east and North have gone South to offer<br/>
higher bounty than is offered in the west.<br/>
Southerners resent having men from the North try to buy men and take<br/>
their places in the army, and suggest rightfully that the Northerners share<br/>
time heat and burden of the war as they are doing.<br/>
The draft is certain to take a large number of able bodied men. In-<br/>
stead of waiting to be drafted, if men will volunteer, there will be left a<br/>
large bounty for dependents; but if drafted there will be left little or .<br/>
nothing. Substitutes will command from $1,000 to $1,500, and none but the<br/>
rich can hope to secure them.<br/>
"Let these facts be understood generally. Do not place your independence<br/>
on recruiting agencies in the Scuth." (10)<br/>

2457 - L. Jan. 18; ed: 2/3 - We have General Meade's opinion on when the<br/>
army of the Potomac will advance, and when the war will close. He says:<br/>
"We are making every effort to improve the present, and as soon as the<br/>
weather moderates and the season will allow, active operations will com-<br/>
mence in earnest. The war must be ended by the hard fighting people's<br/>
work. Peace will possibly be here next summer." (3)<br/>

2458 - L. Jan. 23; ed: 2/1 - There is a lull in military affairs. Plans for<br/>
the spring and summer campaigns are brewinº. The hopes of the Rebels so.<br/>
far are crushed. They hold out, mainly waiting for new results under a<br/>
new administration. Grant thinks they look to the conservatives for res-<br/>
toration. General Jackson can't muster more than 100,000 men. General<br/>
Grant has 20,000 more, but with the serious handicap of operations hundreds<br/>
of miles away.<br/>
"Let the authorities be strong and vigilant. Let them not lose the<br/>
golden hour for the concentration of all scattered energies. Let every<br/>
available man in the west be forwarded to Grant." - (17)<br/>

Atlanta, several boys were collected around a house where there were sev-<br/>
eral fine-lonking young women. One of them remarked "You'ns don't<br/>

The Rebels announce they will hold Atlanta till the last; and if they<br/>
are finally driven out, they will leave it in ashes. -<br/>

this is a great loss and keenly felt. We hope to be in Atlanta soon." (15)<br/>

Confederacy. Of special interest is his description of the fortifications<br/>
of Savannah and the condition of that city. He says: "The river at Fort<br/>
Jackson is lined with thirty-six huge siege guns. The river is blocked with<br/>
heavy timbers leaving just enough room for a boat to pass. Just above this<br/>
entrance are two ironclads, well manned, and above these are torpedoes.<br/>
Their location is known, by the sharp pointed projection of a log about<br/>
six inches from the surface. No man could be seen at, or near the forti-<br/>
fication, earth works being thrown up around the guns for the men's pro-<br/>
tection. These guns, together with obstructions in the river, are intended<br/>
to crush anything that may come up but offer little resistance from a land<br/>
force from the direction of Savannah. Sherman will have little difficulty<br/>
at this point. The swamps will impede his progress more than anything<br/>
else. The force at Savannah is composed of old men, little boys and<br/>
crippled officers. Business of all kinds in the city is stopped, re- -<br/>

only fighting for boundary lines. This is utterly false. Those who have<br/>

dependent power, ard that peace can come only by separation. Ile says º<br/>

2579 - L. Aug. 22; ed: 2/1 - The American people are so tired of war<br/>
that they are liable to accept terms of peace which will shift burdens<br/>

source of all war woes and is prolo.jging the war. -<br/>

with jealousies of North and South there would be constant danger of<br/>
other ruptures and finally, of war again. The only condition of a -<br/>

The Rebels give no indication that they are ready to accept peace<br/>

treating for peace in earnest "until every hostile soldier shall have<br/>
been withdrawn from our soil, and every hostile ship from our waters."<br/>

2585 - L Oct. 17; ed: 2/2 - Alexander Stephens of Georgia is said to<br/>
favor a peace which will recognize the "Sovereignty of the States,"<br/>
also to be in favor of a convention of states.<br/>
"This is very ingenious. Stephens favors having the North admit the<br/>
very principle against which we have contended, the 'sovereign right'<br/>
of a state to secede whenever she sees fit. This doctrine has been the<br/>
cause of all our woes. The hel lish work of leaders in the South was<br/>
done under the guise of State Sovereignty, the right of which Stephens<br/>
wishes to see granted by a convention of States." - (4)<br/>
and<br/>
2586 - L. Oct. 19, ed.:2/1 - Alexander H. Stephens thinks a convention<br/>
of states would be a gocq thing, provided the Confederacy is first<br/>
recognized as an independent power. Nor would he be willing to leave<br/>
the questions in dispute to the absolute decision of such a body.<br/>
This is a political trick. Stephens regards the peace movement in<br/>
the North as "part of the fruits" of the resolutions passed by the<br/>
Georgia legislature that states are sovereign powers and have the right<br/>
to secede when they see fit.<br/>
"Mr. Stephens might as well give up his ideas of new Confederacies<br/>
that shall embrace the north-west. The north-west-stands by the whole<br/>
Union in all its integrity and will fight to the bitter end to main-<br/>

2605 - L. Aug. 11; ed: 2/1 - The reasons why so many thousands of prisoners<br/>
are held by the Rebels and by the Union are because the authorities on<br/>
both sides cannot agree as to the number of paroled and exchanged<br/>
prisoners; also to the recognition by Rebel authorities of Negro soldiers<br/>
as prisoners of war. - -<br/>
Prisoners taken by the Rebels are treated poorly, being half starved<br/>
and lacking medical care, while prisoners taken by the North are treated<br/>
just the opposite. - -<br/>
"The duty of the government is that of retaliation, until every man. .<br/>
wearing the uniform of an American soldier is respected." (6)<br/>

in Andersonville, Ga., and conditions are pitiable, to say the least.<br/>
They are exposed to the terrific heat of the sun by day, and the damp-<br/>
ness of the dew by night. Many of them are suffering from disease and<br/>
some even lose their minds. Others go across the "dead line" and beg<br/>
to be shot to end their misery.<br/>
This cruel policy has heen executed by the Rebels to compel the<br/>
government to accede to their terms of exchange.<br/>
"Why do not the friends of the chivalry here in the North lay before<br/>
their readers a statement of the cruel ties practiced upon our soldiers,<br/>
and seize every opportunity to declaim against any apparent severity<br/>
towards rebel prisoners in the North, while they have not a manly word<br/>

General Butler refuses to exchange "until every man dressed in the<br/>

a soldier, not as one to be sold into slavery.<br/>
The Rebels at present treat all colored soldiers as runaway slaves.<br/>
All officers of colored regiments, by an order from Jeff Davis which<br/>
has not yet been repealed, are delivered over to the state authorities<br/>
to be treated as criminals subject to death.<br/>
The position of Butler is sustained by every principle of national<br/>
and municipal law.<br/>
"Their sºameful abuse of our men in Georgia, over which Ould af-<br/>
fects to shed tears, has been solely for the purpose of compelling our<br/>

highett patriotism and courage of the nation. The soldiers who have<br/>
fought with Sherman and withstood all of the hardships of war are<br/>

political party is proposing to surrender to the Rebels all that has been<br/>
achieved.<br/>
"They cannot but feel that the glory and dignity of our great armies<br/>
are insulted. Let the people shake off all fears and doubts and catch<br/>
the spirit of the men on the front edge of battle." (13)<br/>

Europe is spending a great deal of time on the subject of how to care<br/>
for the sick and wounded soldiers, and has arranged to hold a confer-<br/>
ence in Geneva, Switzerland, to consider some vital points. If adopted,<br/>
they will mitigate the horrors of war. (6)<br/>

2719 - H Aug. 5:4/2 - In a letter to the editor, F. W. Bingham writes<br/>
regarding some of the needs of our soldiers and gives suggestions as<br/>
to what kinds of food to send. He says: "The suggestions are designed-<br/>
ly limited to certain articles, with the hope that attention will be<br/>
directed to their preparation while the material can be obtained." (8)<br/>

2720 - L Aug. 30; ed:2/1, 3 - On a recent journey to Washington, we<br/>
visited the hospital in Armory Square in charge of Dr. D. W. Bliss,<br/>
formerly of this city. A complete survey of the whole place was made,<br/>
and we found that every convenience and care that could be thought of<br/>
was administered to the wounded soldiers. Volunteer nurses and many<br/>
ladies of refinement are giving their services and their time to care<br/>
for these wounded, with no thought of compensation but the gratitude of<br/>
the patients.<br/>
"These noble women, some of them girls, perform their duties in a<br/>
quiet manner..."<br/>
The general appearance of cheerfulness that prevails in all the wards<br/>
is a most refreshing feature. A special diet, served to those whose<br/>
appetites require something different from the ordinary diet, is pur-<br/>
chased from a fund made up from the proceeds of the sale of swill, bones,<br/>
and other garbage, producing $40 a month. The sutler's tax of $120 a<br/>
month and the pay of 18 nurses, generously given to the fund in addition<br/>
to the government allowance, enables Dr. Bliss to "grant the request of<br/>
any sick or wounded soldier for any little articles of luxury he may ask<br/>
for.<br/>
"We, the people of the North, may well feel proud of our hospitals<br/>
if Armory Square is a sample of them." (52)<br/>

2721 - L. Sept. 1; ed: 2/3 - There are those who regard all efforts to<br/>
supply soldiers in the army with tobacco as tending to ill-health and<br/>
dissipation. It is a fact that tobacco affords more solace and comfort<br/>
to those who are in the habit "of using it," than anything else money<br/>
can buy; and it is not as likely to create sickness as some seem to<br/>
think.<br/>
"We have no word of commendation for the habit, and think it filthy<br/>
and unnecessary, and one that young men should avoid. However these<br/>
soldiers in camp and field who have used tobacco, crave it, and it<br/>
should be furnished them if it gives the least amount of comfort to<br/>
their tedious lives." (6)<br/>

Cumberland, gave a report of his experiences in the South, details<br/>
concerning the care of the sick and wounded soldiers, and reflections<br/>
suggested by his visit and work in the armies of Georgia.<br/>
The most intelesting part of Reverend Mr. Wolcott's address was his<br/>
testimony to the hopeful condition of the Negroes in portions of the<br/>
South taken by the North. He also spoke of the moral tone of the army<br/>
as being, on the whole, much higher than represented. There is much<br/>
profanity, but as regards intemperance, the men have as much temptation<br/>
at home. Intemperance is almost wholly confined to officers. He ended<br/>
his address by speaking of various agencies established to secure comfort<br/>
for the soldiers. (13)<br/>

life should be held. Men used to shudder at the very thought of using<br/>
firearms; but since the war, they talk freely of using them, which is<br/>
absolutely wrong and should be punished to the full extent of the law,<br/>
whether they be soldiers or private citizens.<br/>
"In view of the growing recklessness of society, and the tendency<br/>
of returned soldiers to use arms on the least provocation; in view of<br/>
the interests of civilization, and the dignity and honor of the laws<br/>
of civilized communities, we invoke all citizens to cultivate a health-<br/>
ier public sentiment and save us from the barbarism of dirks and re-<br/>
volvers. If we are not to degenerate into a blood-thirsty race of men,<br/>
with whom life is of little consequence so long as the murderer has a<br/>
provocation, or some wealth to shield him, we must put a check to the<br/>
unlicensed use of firearms." (16)<br/>

worth of the commission in northern Virginia respecting the contrabands.<br/>
He said things went badly with this large and increasing class until<br/>
General Butler issued his famous order "No 14, " whose doctrine was that<br/>
the freedmen are the inevitable charge and children of the government.<br/>
He stated that before the announcement of that doctrine, "the condition<br/>
of the blacks was worse than slavery itself. They were kicked about,<br/>
defrauded and abused." But under General Butler's policy the black<br/>
colony is growing in every respect. They are thriving in schools, on<br/>
farms, and fast learning the science and Art of life." (18)<br/>
