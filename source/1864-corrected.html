WPA Project 16492
Introduction:
In the ANNALS OF CLEVELAND, an attempt is made to answer a need
long felt by scholars; that of preserving and making readily accessible the
detailed record of a city's life and culture as contained in its newspapers.
The Annals are to be a set of at least one volume per year, covering the
years 1818 - 1935 and including an abstract of every newspaper story that
has recorded a local event or expressed a local opinion. Abstracts are filed
chronologically under subject headings alphabetically ordered. The abstracts
thus arranged are numbered consecutively. A chronological index brings to-
gether by number all abstracts from the newspaper of a given date, and a
proper names and subject heading index offers an additional check.
The editors have sought to preserve and arrange in this series informa-
tion that is nowhere else available and readily subject to control. To avoid
duplication they have concentrated their efforts on one major newspaper
file - the principal one for the period. This method of work leaves out of
account the diversities of opinion expressed by other newspapers. In the
hope that the other files may be covered in respect of opinions there ex-
pressed, the present volune is numbered Part I. Part II, when and as pro-
duced, will complete the presentation of opinion from other sources.
The file of the Cleveland LEADER has been used in the preparation of
this volume. In 1864 the editor of the LEADER was Edwin C. Cowles. Its
policies were Republican.
In 1864 the LEADER file contained 225,360 column inches. The number

should be taxed rather than the necessaries of life. In the effort to -

now the chief revenue of England is obtained by the taxation of but
comparatively few articles.
"All the articles subject to customs duties in England are the fol-
lowing: The cereal products, hops, mahogany, foreign spirits, sugar,
coffee, tea, timber, cocoa, wood, tobacco and wine.
"From the articles above mentioned 24,000,000 pounds sterling are
obtained...."

our national debt will fall chiefly upon the wealthy instead of the
poor." . . (8)

153 - L Dec. 8: ed: 2/1 - Despite the ravages and desolation of the war,
the loyal states have increased their population since 1860. This fact
was brought out in the President's message. The net increase is well
over 100,000, which shows that there are still plenty of men to carry
on the war and to put down the Rebellion.
"It is the wonderful growth of the North that alarmed the Rebels in
days gone by. They knew they would inevitably be out-voted in the leg-
islative halls of the nation and sought, therefore, to escape the con-
sequences by plunging into this strife. The dream of a great slave
empire bordering on the Gulf is forever gone. The free population of -
the North is to inherit the South." (8)

"In this is found the essential divergence from the religion of Christ.
It is the glory of His religion, that it does no harm to soil it by every
day use." (17)

The visiting committee introduced a resolution that the Sunday
school interests of the city demand an immediate canvass to secure the
attendance of every child of suitable age in some Sunday school, and
when thus gathered, the teachers should find some means to keep them
there. - - (17)
162 - L. Feb. 11:2/2 - The elegant church edifice erected during the
past year by the liberality and enterprise of Euclid church will be
dedicated by the Rev. A. S. Hayden, the present pastor of the Disciple
church of Euclid. (2)
163 - L Feb. 12; ed:4/2 - Everybody had heard of, though we hope nobody
has joined, the new church of that "blessed martyr," Dr. Olds. The
church is intended particularly for the accommodation of Wallandigham,
Sam Cox, George Bliss, Judge Abley, a -d other "Democratic" gentlemen of
elevated morals and tender consciences.
Everybody, therefore, ought to go and hear the Columbians sing their
new hymn tonight, written expressly for that church. (2)
164 - L. Feb. 24; ed: 2/1 - Bishop Ames of the Methodist church and other
authorities of the Baptist denomination have taken over the abandoned
parishes in the South. The "Copperheads' think that they have no right
to do this.
"The shoe pinches. The Copperheads wanted to take over these churches
and start them with a new religion invented by Olds." (4)
165 - L. May 9:4/2 - A gathering of all Sabbath schools in the city will
be held at the Second Presbyterian church. T. P. Handy and Loren
Prentiss will give the addresses. (1)
166 - L June 13:4/2 - Four hundred teachers and students of the Congre-
gational Sabbath school and the Washington st. school joined in a picnic

held in the Second Presbyterian church. The Rev. J. H. Rylance will
give an address. (2)
168 - L. Aug. 23; ed: 3/1 - The pulpit in this country is no longer ham-
pered by rigid and formal mannerisms, which in some countries make
preaching mere ceremonies. Clergymen of today need to be practical as
well as religious and to assume an attitude equal to their fellowmen.
Peculiarities that weaken the influence of a minister are his underesti-
mation of the ability and intelligence of his audience and the practice
of written sermons. Another peculiarity is, that ministers spend too
much time among books and not enough among living people. - --

"A few hours spent each day conversing with men of all classes and opin-
ions, not only familiarizes the minister with the feeling of men on relig-
ious ideas, but brings them into more active sympathy with the world. There
is far too little of hearty communication with the world and too much priestly
isolation from the living, suffering, and hoping human hearts of today."

169 - L. Sept. 17:2/2-4 - In a sermon delivered Sept. 11, the Reverend Mr.
Gillette declared that the United States should protect itself against all
enemies, and gave his blessing to all soldiers in the army.
We may, with the integrity of the Union, anticipate a homogeneous peo-
ple throughout the whole country. With the cause of local strife extinct,
a diffusion of intelligence will prevail all over the land. Southern aris-
tocracy shall no more raise its embankments against floods of intelligence
and light.... The steady work of advancing truth shall girdle around the
abode of polygamy, and that relic of barbarism, the twin-sister of savery,
shall pass into oblivion. We may then look for a reaction from rival
practices and the extensions of virtue, morality, and religion over all.

delivered a sermon yesterday based upon the test of "Fveryone that asketh,
receiveth." He said: "It is a great mistake to suppose, as many have
done, that men may pray and pray, yet receive no reply.... 'Everyone that
asketh receiveth" ... an ungodly nation must of necessity reap the vengeance
of the Almighty, while a faithful and prayerful people will as certainly
reap his blessing.... statesmen alone can never save a people.... God estimates
a nation...by the character of its people....neither President nor armies
can save us... God alone can save, and unless our sins as a nation are so
ripe, that our death has been decreed, God will save us in answer to the
submission, humiliation, and prayer of our people.... The immediate cause of
all our troubles being the want of purity and unselfish patriotism in the
national councils, let us seek to deserve, and pray God to raise up to us
leaders with whom unselfish love of country shall prevail over every other
consideration." (28)

188 - H Nov. 25:2/3 - The Rev. J. Monteith, jr., deliv red a sermon yester-
day in the Euclid st. Presbyterian church, based upon Ps. 23:6.
"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies." He
contrasted the present prosperity during the war with the want and slaugh-
ter of past wars. He praised the North for their "progress of freedom".
and all the good they were doing and had done. "In view of all this, is
there any man before me who dare allow the finger of his conscience to in-
scribe upon his country's sword the word, 'failure'?... The 8th of November
was the most anxious day in history, but its sun set in a cloud of trium-
phant glory. The result was one for which we have sung, and wept, and
prayed, and talked, and worked. Those who think the war a failure, and who
must therefore regard the 8th of November as the gloomiest day in history,
had better, like Job, clothe themselves with the sackcloth and sit in the
ashes of repentence." (23)

"The increase in the salary of the Chief Engineer of the Fire Depart-
ment is especially commendable. The office is one of great responsibility,
demanding an experienced, quick, courageous, comm inding man. It is also
a difficult, hazardous, expensive, and annoying office. Five hundred dol-

CIVIL OPPOSITION - Wallandigham Case (Cont'd)
213 - L. May 28; ed: 1/1,2 - Wallandigham occupies a suite of rooms at the
Hirons House in Windsor, Canada. His sitting-room windows face the
river, giving him a view of the water front of Detroit. He sits with
field glasses in his hand, watching all who cross on the ferry. All who
see him must have satisfactory introductions. About every three weeks
he makes a trip into the interior. Strange to say, no one crosses the
river to see him during his absence, but immediately upon his return his
room is full of guests. They are deserters from the Rebel army, Rebel
agents, spies and riff-raff of outlaws made up of Morgan's men.
"It may be observed, however, that if the accumulation of dirt is any
criterion of the exact locality of the (aegis), Windsor must certainly
be the place." - (17)
214 - L. June 17; ed: 2/1 - Wallandigham reappears. He looks upon the
180,000 men who voted for him as backers. If taken by legal process, he
proposes to submit. He misrepresents his case again, endeavoring to shift
the burden of his responsibility.
"Mr. Wallandigham made a very feeble attempt to justify himself in his
present return, endeavoring by reiterating the same ideas he advanced a
year ago, to prove that his arrest was unjust." (9)
215 - L. June 19; ed: 2/1 - Wallandigham might be favored with renewed
martyrdom, by reasons of his re-arrest. Sympathy for him would enable his
followers to control the Chicago convention. The real party managers are
alarmed; they know that the martyr added 50,000 votes last fall to the
Union party in Ohio. "In their inmost heart they wish Wallandigham had
never returned to Ohio." (5)
216 - L. Oct. 17; ed: 2/1 - A report from Judge Advocate Holt tells of
secret treason societies existing in the North, whose objective has been
to assist Rebel states to secure their independence.
"We do not believe that any great number of people would themselves
engage in open revolution, but may have been induced by wicked leaders to
join treasonable organizations, and might be led by them to open revolu-
tion." (6)

from various colleges during these past weeks, and with a large portion of
them, the diploma is only an "evidence that a certain amount of time has
been spent within the bounds of some particular educational institution."
They have failed to achieve the fundamentals set forth in the college
curriculum which makes for an education of which one is to be proud.
Another phase of college life is prevalent, however, in the colleges
of the west, which are more favorable to the general distribution of a
moderately good education than are New England colleges, though a vast
improvement could be made, because both eastern and western colleges turn
out "graduates who could scarcely be admitted into the freshman year of
the best colleges in the country."
Scholarships in western colleges are denominational, and students
cramped by theological opinions are apt to become intolerant bigots.

ties of such magnificent facilities as are possessed by some of the German

CONFEDERACY (Cont'd)
Senator Brown says that every white man of any age, occupation, reli-
gion, etc., should be conscripted into the Confederate army.
He could not trust the Negroes, so they would be barred. The duties
of civil life would thus be performed by army detail. Hatred of the
Confederate cause is very noticeable. (8)
249 - L. Jan. 6; ed: 2/3 - "The seizure of so much Rebel currency in New
York is unfortunate for us. Why not let Memminger have it. Another
hundred millions would only be a feather that would break the Rebel
camel's back. Send it to Dixie and let us martyrize Ililton, the printer,
by inviting him to a speedy cz it from this unhappy world. (2)
250 - L. Jan. 8: ed:2/1 - From the general tore of a letter written by the
Rebel minister of war, James A. Seddon, to Quartermaster-General A. C.
Myers, the farmers in western North Carolina have given evidence of their
unwillingness to be taxed any further for the Southern cause, and are un-
willing to have their crops taken by the Confeder te government. Seddon
instructs the Quartermaster-General to issue orders to these fellows to
deliver one-tenth of their crops at once. "The ultimate result of this
growirg disaffection in the South will be the overthrow of the terrible
despotism of Jefferson Davis." (8)
251 - L. Jan. 18; ed: 2/1 - Jeff Davis called upon Pope Pius IX and talked
about peace. Pope Pius replied that Davis should "exert himself and stop
the civil war in the United States, that the people may enjoy peace

"Jeff will possibly see that this is an invitation to abscond from the
Confederacy, save his neck, fly to Rome and rest under the shadow of the
great toe he kisses with such veneration." - (6)

254 - L Jan. 27; ed: 2/1, 2 - Governor Letcher, who defended the Rebellion,
has subsided into private life and William Smith has been inaugurated.
Governor Smith's inaugural efforts were chiefly devoted to the old stale
fallacies about state rights which have been the bane and destruction of
the South. He claims that from the day of the Constitution to the day of
the Rebellion the South always made concessions to the North.
"He is a cunning Governor and when affairs are so gloomy, he does well
to talk about State rights. Why, Governor Smith, do you not deal with
practical questions of the day?" (8)
255 - L. Feb. 4; ed: 2/1 - School books found on the captured blockade run-
ner EILA, bore the dedication "To His excellency, Jefferson Davis, presi-
dent of C. S. A." This series of books, selected from the best texts,
and prepared and adapted to the wants of the Southern states, is respect-
fully dedicated "by yours, etc. K. J. Stewart, London, England, June 15,
1863." "It was an outrage to prevent the reception of these instructive
volumes by the persons for whom they were intended; but such is the fate
of war, and blockade-running is a risky business." (5)
256 - L. Feb. 11; ed: 2/3 - General Grant says that the non-slaveholders of
the South, small farmers cultivating their own lands, never did unite in
the Rebellion. "Democrats! hear General Grant, and be convinced that
your brethren of the humbler middle class at the South are Unionists to-
day, and have always been at heart true to the Old Flag." (3)
257 - L. Feb. 13; ed: 2/1 - The Reverend Dr. Elliott, commended as a patri-
otic bishop according to Rebel ideas of patriotism, addressed his flock
in Savannah lately concerning the awful results of submission to the

the Rebel army thundered at the gates of Washington they might have sub-
mitted to the conservative and Christian people of the North. But now
we must lock our shields and trust in God."
"Alas for Bishop Elliott and his misguided flock. The surge that will

"Suppose they had as many millions, what difference to European bond-
holders so long as we intend to capture it all, together with Jeff and
his rebel horde." (2)
264 - L. Sept. 20; ed:2/2 - News from Southern papers indicates that the
South is making a desperate effort to be cheerful, and to bolster up the

The Richmond blusterers expect some foul play from Governor Brown on the
Confederacy. "Notwithstanding all their fury, it is evident that they
are beginning to distrust their own people." (3)
265 - L Oct. 5; ed:2/4 - "The laborer who proposes to vote for Jeff
Davis, should first read of some plans proposed by rebel papers, and
their views on 'free' things." The Richmond EXAMINER, Alabama HERALD
and Richmond ENQUIRER all speak against free Negroes, free farms, free
thinking, free schools and declare that they are "all in the same cate-
gory, and belong to the same brood of damnable isms."
Howell Cobb, leader in the rebellious movement, advocated enslavement
of all workingmen and women. He says, "there is perhaps no solution of
the problem of reconcil ing the interest of capital and labor, so as to
protect each from the encroachments of the other, so simple as slavery."

267 - L. Oct. 14; ed: 2/3 - The proposed arming of slaves by Rebels is the
last ditch to which Union men are anxious to see the Rebels driven.
In the event Lincoln is reelected, the new war policy will no doubt
be adopted in the South, unless they decide to yield to an inevitable
fatality.
"Put arms into the hands of 100,000 slaves and we should see where
their sympathy lies. It would soon be discovered whether such a thing
is possible as their fighting to enslave their mothers, sisters, wives,
children, fathers and sons. We should have a fine accession to the
strength of the Union cause in such a desperate policy." (3)
268 - L. Oct. 24; ed: 2/1 - Public sentiment in the South for arming slaves
is becoming very strong. This effort is a confession of inability to
succeed with their white population. "The chivalry that have robbed the
cradle and the grave to accomplish their wicked ends, now reach out their
hands asking aid of these people whom they have regarded as nothing but
inferior animals. Now they admit that they will Inake good soldiers,
and indulge the hope that the slaves, with promise of freedom, will
fight bravely for men who have made cattle of them and their children." )

269 - L. Nov. 1; ed: 2/1 - In a recent speech made by Davis at Columbia,
S. C., he refers to the people as "spaniels" and declares the only way
to keep them civil is to whip them.
"It may be well enough for Davis to talk about 'spaniels," but the
day is not far distant when the people of the South will recognize our
army as their deliverer from a worse fate than Egyptian darkness and
bondage." (6)
270 - L Nov. 2; ed:2/2 - Jeff Davis has set aside Nov. 16 as a day for
thanksgiving for the people of the Confederate states. He calls upon
the people to be thankful for the "many signal victories" with which his
arms have been crowned, and for the "fruitful fields with which they have
been blessed," and finally because "He has inspired our hearts and
strengthened our hearts in resistance to the iniquitous designs of our
enemies."
"We fear that Davis has mistaken the inspiration of the devil for
that from above. His recent confessions put the lie upon the profession
he makes in his Proclamation." (5)
271 - L. Nov. 4; ed: 2/1 - It is officially announced in Southern papers
that the Rebels intend arming 300,000 slaves in the spring, giving them
their freedom and 50 acres of land for their services.
"The Negroes of the South have understood from the beginning that,
practically, the North is fighting the battle of their freedom, and it
would not be astonishing if the result of this new desperation of the
Rebellion should only serve to hasten both the overthrow of the Rebellion
and the restoration of the Union." (13)

272 - L Nov. 9; ed: 2/1 - The New York NEWS has undertaken the defense
of the recent movement in the Scuth of arming the slaves. With hypo-
critical anxiety for the welfare of our armies, it asks in feigned
horror: "Unable now to do much more than hold our own against the white
troops of the South, how can we expect to do so when they shall be re-
enforced by four or five hundred thousand able-bodied Negroes."
"The truth is, there has never been a lou er wail of despair than
this new movement to arm the slaves, recommended by the Rebel Governors
and advocated by the Rebel press. It is an a mission that having ex-
hausted all white soldiers, there is no hope for them unless they can
manage to compel the slaves into their support.
"Let this last movement in the hideous catalogue of crimes, perpe-
trated by the Rebellion only, be carried out, slavery will cease, and
the strength and motive of the Rebellion be gone." (14)
273 - L Nov. 12; ed: 2/1 - From editorials written in Southern newspapers
it would seem that there is a party forming in the South which is be-
ginning to think of some method of obtaining peace without further blocq-
shed. "The reconstruction movement of the South promises to be very
important, and one that will be greatly accelerated by the reelection
of Abraham Lincoln." (11)
274 - L Nov. 15; ed: 2/1 - Jeff Davis' message to tile Rebel Congress
was written in order to put on as good a face to a bad cause as is
possible under the circumstances. He complains that foreign nations
have not seen fit to recognize his independence, and says it has always
been customary to recognize a nation when it became evident that it
could not be subdued. "Nobody but Davis and the Chicago Convention re-
gards the war a failure. The message of that wicked traitor cannot re-
vive the waning fortunes of his people. He only waits a short time be-
fore the avenging sword of liberty and a free people shall overtake him."
(18)
275 - L Nov. 15; ed: 2/2 - The disorganization in the Rebel ranks is very
obvious, with the leaders arguing among themselves concerning the arming

are becoming excited over the prospect of being drafted.
"Altogether they are getting fearfully mixed up." (4)

has sent in his annual report to Rebel Congress. It will attract much
attention as an illustration of what a wily pen can do for a very bad
cause. Everything looks charming to Seddon. He agrees with Davis that
the fall of Atlanta means little, although Governor Brown of Georgia
says that "it is the very heart and railroad center of the Confederacy,
and the loss was a severe blow." Seddon reviews the military situation
by saying that the Rebels have resisted efforts of the enemy by defeat-
ing the largest and best appointed armies, and have thwarted best laid
plans. "We have shown ourselves to be worthy of that separate and equal

place among the nations of the earth which is our birthright, and which
has been unjustly withheld from us." He discusses the question of main-
taining the Rebel armies, also of arming the slaves. He then gives a
review of the conditions of the Rebel cavalry and of the Rebel prisoners
in our hands. He attempts justification of horrible atrocities inflicted
upon Union soliiers in their hands, by saying that the effective drain
by the blockade on their limited resources justified them in taking care
of their own men first. He winds up his harangue by holding out the
threat of arming slaves by way of retaliation. "Do it, we say, we are
anxious to have the last resource of the Confederacy brought forward.
This will complete all labors... except one, and that is, that this in-
iquitous Rebellion has closed its hel lish career." (24)
277 - L Nov. 17; ed: 2/1 - Governor Brown of Georgia is between two fires
and doesn't know how to escape. He hates Davis and Lincoln. He insists
upon the independence of the South and yet he exhorts Georgia soldiers
never to lay down their arms until the despotism of Richmond has recog-
nized the "individual sovereignty of their own State." "We look with
confidence, therefore, to the day when Governor Brown, and men of his
type, will become active in their efforts to restore the Union in more
than its original power - a Union cemented forever by the blood of tens
of thousands of the young men of every State. The duty of the Govern-
ment is to divide the South, and hasten the day of its redemption from
the darkest crimes in history." (13)
278 - L. Nov. 30; ed: 2/1 - The proposition of the Richmond DISPATCH to
have a financial and military dictator to manage affairs in Rebeldom,
is an indication of the rapid approach of a central despotism wielded
by Davis and Lee. It also proves that "there is no hope of accomplish-
ing anything through the Rebel Congress to remedy their financial con-
dition." - (3)
279 - L. Dec. 3; ed:2/2 - By clever management during the early stages
of the war, Davis managed to create the impression that the South was
united on the subject of continuing the war, and that the people of the
South were "welded together in fiery heat of devotion for the Confeder-
acy." "The deceptions practiced are being exposed, and it is growing
more apparent from day to day. The hollow shell of Rebellion must soon
give way and then will be seen how great a delusion is the talk of Rebel
unanimity." (10)

"To this humiliation are Southern nabobs at last brought. In the

tary servitude shall only be permitted as a punishment for crime.
Sec. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this act.
Indications are that this measure will receive sanction. "The
high tide of freedom is sweeping o'er the land and woe to the man who
attempts to stem its impetuous flood." (6)

CONSTITUTION - Amendments (Cont'd)
287 - L June 18; ed:2/1 - The recent vote by which the constitutional
amendment was lost, so far as the vote from Ohio is concerned, is one
of the most flagrant outrages that have been perpetrated against the
honor of our state for many years. Fourteen Democratic Congressmen have
decided that the source and strength of the Rebellion shall not be
weakened or extirpated so far as their services can prevent it. The
Democrats in Congress have decided not to allow the people to say whether
they will so amend the constitution as to prevent the reestablishment
of slavery on the soil of the Republic.
"This action of the Democracy in Congress prefigures the action of
the Chicago Convention upon the subject of slavery." (12)
288 - L Dec. 14; ed:2/2 - The national boor, Garret Davis of Kentucky,
having abandoned the constitution as it is, propose to amend it, and
has submitted a lot of trash to the U. S. Senate. He proposes that
Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire shall be run into one state, and
Massachusetts. Connecticut, and Rhode Island into another, etc.; that
the President shall be chosen alternately from the free and slave states;
and that no Negro shall be a citizen of the United States.
"In these three years, the nation has ceased to prattle about division
of power between free and slave states, for it has decided that there shall
be no slave st: tes.... Your amendments, Sir, are incoherent murmurings
of a sleeping dotard and should be treated as such. Cease groping for
the relics of a past which can never be resurrected and open your eyes
to the glorious rising sun and be silent." (11)
Maryland
289 - L. Oct. 13; ed:2/2 - If the constitution, framed at Annapolis, is
adopted, it places Maryland alongside of the free states of the North.
It prohibits slavery, and compensates masters whose slaves are made free
by the Constitution; it prohibits lotteries and provides that no person
who has assisted the Rebellion shall hold office, or vote, unless par-
doned by a two-thirds vote of the members of the assembly. "It is a
vigorously and wisely framed constitution, and will bring Maryland into
the fold of Free States." (3)
Missouri
290 - L. Nov. 14; ed:2/1 - The adoption of the new constitution of
Missouri forever prohibiting slavery in that state was of an importance
not to be exaggerated. "Revolutions never go backward, especially those
revolutions which have God and Freedom on their side. Men now gray-
haired shall live to see the last fetter fall from the last slave - and
to thank God for his glorious work." (5)

291 - L Dec. 3; ed:2/1 - The subject of organizing cooperative societies

kind with a membership of 100,000, and showing in every respect most
desirable results." (5)

Richard William Waughn, a Stafford linen draper. In 1678 he counter-

longer bank notes might have been free from imitation had this man not
shown with what ease they might be counterfeited." (3)

money, was arrested by the U. S. marshal. (1)

cheap in war, but life should not be considered cheap under any circum-
stance. It is a sacred thing and not to be yielded up voluntarily except

strict accountability for undue speed and recklessness." (3)

W. B. Castle was chosen candidate for the commissioner of water works and
George Hester, for justice of the peace. One person was appointed from
each ward as a member of the city Union central committee. (10)

think the present election unimportant, but go and vote the Union ticket."

573 - L. Apr. 5:4/3 - "The City Election, which transpired yesterday, re-
sulted in a glorious triumph for the Union cause. Only a light vote, -
about six thousand, was polled, and yet the Union majority for the city
ticket will not fall far short of Fifteen Hundred, a majority that has
surprised the most sanguine of the Union men, and which is heavier than any
ever before given at a city election in which so light a vote was polled.
The Union nominees for Councilmen are also successful in at least eight
Wards, and the council will be decidedly Union. Three times three for
the glorious Forest City! Never has it done itself more honor than in
repudiating the bastard Democracy, and in opening the Presidential campaign
of 1864 with a salute for the Union whose echoes shall ring through all
the borders of the land!
"The election passed off very quietly, no disturbance of any kind taking
place at any of the places of election. In most of the wards the vote was
light, and little or no interest taker. So great was the apathy, in fact,
and such the vigor with which the Democrats worked, that it was generally
feared that the Democracy would carry the city. In view of the fact, the
triumph is even greater and proves more conclusively that the great heart
of the people still beats for Liberty and Union."
The LEADER carries the complete vote of each ward, except the Seventh,
which had not reported at press time, although it was said Union nominees
had carried tº his ward also .

mously adopted. (29)

No soldiers' votes for this election have been received, either by the county
or city clerk, and, indeed, as far as is known, none have ever been cast.
The returns from the various wards were opened and counted yesterday morn-
ing. . They agree so nearly in all respects with the returns which we pub-
lished the morning, after the election that it is not worth while to repro-
duce them in detail. We give the total vote for water works commissioner
and justice of the peace. Water works commissioner - Willam B. Castle
(Union) 3,730, Morrison Foster (Democrat) 2, 154. - - -
Justice of the peace • George Hester (Union) 3,682, J. S. Allen (Democrat)

The Union nominees for constables were all elected.
On the proposition to annex a part of Brooklyn to the city, the vote was
as follows: For annexation, 4, 171; against annexation, 11.

has done well during the war, there have been some of the boldest and vilest
'Copperheads' at work in the midst of the loyal men. Their new candidate,
Origen E. Seymour, is known as a 'Copperhead'.... We trust the loyal men
of that state will administer as decent a burial to the blessed martyr, Origen
E. Seymour, as did Ohio to its political saint. In this death grapple the
Republic, with the hydra, rebellion, the man who is not wholly, entirely for

for as Ohio goes in October, she will go in November. The result is not
doubtful, "and we believe that the state will not only go right, but will
pile up a majority for the Union that will make the hearts of the "Copper-

landers. Eloquent orators and experienced statesmen are to speak, and

illumination. "All in all we expect tomorrow's demonstration to be a most
glorious and fitting one." . . . (6)
590 - L. Oct. 5:4/3,8 - The grand Union rally held today, was in all respects,
a most complete and wonderful success. In spite of the rain, the city was
decorated in gala day attire. "The banner of glory and beauty floated
proudly from the flagstaff on the Square, and flags of all sizes hung from
roofs, windows, and ropes stretched across the streets." The whole city
was enthused and excited. Crowds came in trains and private conveyances
from every direction. Surrounding townships turned out in full force, East
Cleveland receiving the banner for having the largest delegation present. --
The meeting was called to order by H. M. Chapin. Judge Spaulding made a
brief speech in regard to the death of Governor Wood, who was to have pre-
sided at the meeting. Judge Day of Ravenna then made an address which he
began by reviewing the history of the secession movement. Ile spoke at
length on the Union cause and the duty of loyal men toward it. His speech
was received with much enthusiasm and applause.
The Hon. Benjamin Stanton was the next and last speaker. He spoke in
defense of the course Lincoln had taken, and showed how many things he had
thought unwise, had since been proved the very wisest measures. He defended
the emancipation proclamation and eulogized Sherman on his recent campaign.
He then showed up the weakness and absurdity of the "Chicago Platform."

publicans lost 61,000 votes, but the truth is that the majority of Republican

The PLAIN DEALER is following in the footsteps of the WORLD - or
rather it lies more desperately. To what desperate straits is a party re-
duced which must resort to such magnificent and enormous frauds. (3)
596 - L. Oct. 15; ed: 2/3 - The PLAIN DEALER stated in one issue that the
Democrats had cut down the Union majority in Ohio from 101,000 to 35,000.

a difference of "only" 50,000. "This is what the PLAIN DEALER calls sub-
serving the ends of 'justice and truth.' Honest men call it downright
swindling." (2)

"In this withdrawal, Chase is not overvalued by the people of Ohio. They
esteem him the more. By his withdrawal he unites all men on Lincoln. No
military man as yet can claim the presidency." (15)
607 - L. Mar. 21; ed: 2/1 - Admirers of George B. McClellan got up a mass

his renomination. They have therefore been industriously at work for months,
endeavoring to undermine public confidence. Their savage onslaughts have
been stayed for a few weeks by the important events transpiring; but their
former malignity was not misunderstood. The integrity, purity, and ability
of the President, the universal confidence of the people, have been powerful
reasons with the opposition why he should not be renominated.
"From every quarter come the evidences that these qualities are being
appreciated and that the people are unanimously in his favor.

gentlemen who affect to be in favor of a still more radical candidate.
In view of the fact that the soundest anti-slavery men of the nation are
in favor of Mr. Lincoln's renomination, it little becomes the mal contents
who are to meet in this city to prate about a more radical anti-slavery
policy. They can come before the Union men of the country with but
little grace and still less hope of popular approbation. Henry Ward Beecher,
in writing to a distinguished Indiana politician at Washington, says what
will be endorsed by all good Union men:
"In the present exigency, in view of Mr. Lincoln's past administration,
the wision he has shown, the inoral purity of the man, the great and just
confidence which the people put in him... I am full and strong in my con-
viction that he should be our next president." (9)
613 - L May 26; ed: 2/1 - Henry Ward Beecher is strong in conviction that
Mr. Lincoln should be our next president. "Mr. Beecher and Mr. Garrison
are true friends of negro freedom." (4)
614 - L. May 30; ed: 2/2 - The time draws near for the Baltimore convention,
and the people are universally for Lincoln. "Copperhead" newspapers every-
where are boosting Fremont and knocking Lincoln. "The army of the Union at
the front and the army of the Union at the North are one and undivisible.
The one will triumph over rebels in arms, the cther over Copperheads every-
where." (5)
615 - L May 31; ed: 2/1, 2 - The choice of the American people for the next
president is Abraham Lincoln. The pecple are unwilling to distract and
divide the strength of the Union sentiment of the country by canvassirg the
claims of other men than Abraham Lincoln. -
"The people have chosen Abraham Lincoln for their next president. It is
a foregone conclusion. What then can you say to them, gentlemen of the
freedom and undivided country, if, as you think, you shall defeat their
choice and commit a crime against the very cause you love." (22)
616 - L June 2; ed: 3/2 - General McClellan had 153,000 men when he went
to the peninsula in March 1862. When the President visited him Julv 20,
1862, he had 80,000, showing a loss of 78,500 killed, wounded, deserters,
prisoners, and discharged. This loss of men meant "defeat and disaster, a
campaign lost, the invasion of Maryland, great public gloom and discontent,
followed by Copperhead triumphs at the elections, and a general disloyal
clamor for a disunion peace." Ever since that time McClellan has stood high
in the esteem of disloyalists. This ruin "together with his pro-slavery
principles, is the secret of his immense popularity with that organization
(Copperhead)." - (6)

nominated at Baltimore, such is the disgust felt by his party towards him
that it is probable the presidential race in Ohio will be between the Dem-
ocratic nominee and Fremont.
"Now in opposition to this the coolest of cool assumptions, we put our
prediction upon record, that General Fremont, even if an electoral vote
for his support is formed, will not poll 5,000 votes in the State of º

618 - L June 4; ed:2/1 - The Cincinnati COMMERCIAL says that the chief
accusation of the "Fremonters" against Mr. Lincoln is that "he is a man of
good common sense." "And we add, that he is a man of such uncommon
honesty, that the people prefer him before all other men." (2)
619 - L June 7; ed: 1/2 - McClellan resigned his major general ship on en-
tering the presidential race. "The people are heartily sick of ball room
Major-Generals, and candidates will find sheathed swords useless weapons
in the coming contest." - (2)
620 - L June 9; ed: 1/1 - Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, and Andrew Johnson,
the citizen of Tennessee who rose from a tailor's apprentice to the U. S.
Senate, yesterday at the Union convention in Baltimore were renominated as
president and vice president, respectively.
"As surely as the sun shall rise on the morning of election day, so
surely shall the overwhelming voice of a grateful people, speaking in its
majestic might, declare that Lincoln shall retain the seat which for four
years he has filled with such honesty, ability and patriotism." (11)
621 - L June 10; ed:2/1 - The National Union convention has adjourned. The
only matter of real importance was selecting a platform. "Their platform
pledges the Union party to aid the government in quelling the Rebellion and
in bringing Rebels and traitors to punishment.
"The people are with the convention, and their action will, in November
next, put its seal of approval upon the proceedings at Baltimore." (16)
622 - L June 11; ed: 2/1 - Andrew Johnson, the nominee for vice president,
was born at Raleigh, N. C., Dec. 29, 1808. He is now 55 years old. At the
age of ten he was apprenticed to a tailor, and served him seven years.
"He is like Lincoln, eminently a man of the people, and a self made man.

623 - L June 13; ed: 2/1 - The New York WORLD writes on the recent nomina-
tions at Baltimore. It called those nominated, Lincoln and Johnson, a rail
splitting buffoon and a boorish tailor.
"Why, the very fact that the Union nyminees are taken from the people -
that one was once a rail-splitter, and the other a tailor - will be the
chief element of their popularity." (8)

Cooper institute to ratify the nomination of Lincoln. The speech of

"The meeting was immensely enthusiastic, and high toned in its express-
ions of devotion to the cause of the country, and human liberty everywhere."

625 - L. July 1; ed: 3/2 - A Democratic congressman remarked to Jim Wade
that stump speech-making is a very hard job. Mr. Wade agreed with him but
told him that there would be little use for it during this election, de-
claring that Mr. Lincoln would run himself and that the people had already
elected him and saved us a good deal of trouble. (6)

For president, Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, for vice-president,
Andrew Johnson of Tennessee. - - - (1)
627 - L. July 30; ed: 2/1 - The time to nominate a congressman from this dis-
trict is near at hand, and the people will do well to renominate Judge
Spaulding who has been faithful in his services and has achieved a national
reputation. His efforts to get the bankruptcy bill passed, and his
support of government measures recessary to carry on the war, including
the tax bill, the loan bill, and the proposed amendment to the constitution
to abolish slavery, are proof of his dependability under circumstances.
"It is with pleasure that we endorse Judge Spaulding's renomination for
Congress." - (9)
628 - L. Aug. 13; ed: 2/1,2 - Two things outstanding in the speeches at Mc-
Clellan's meeting in New York city were condemnation of the present ad-
ministration and praise of McClellan.
Present indications are that there will be a big fight among Democrats
at Chicago, but McClellan will succeed, since "he is the only general
available, and the Democratic leaders who are hungering for power, will
take the man who will run best." . . . - - - (7)
629 - L. Aug. 18; ed: 2/1 - The delay of the Chicago convention has been un- .
fortunate for the Union party. All discouraging elements have had free
play because Democrats have not found a suitable candidate. Union men are
waking up to the fact that in unity there is strength and that dissensions
must be cast aside. Personal preferences of individuals must be sacrificed
to the demands of a great cause. The hope of the Democratic party lies in
these last two months, and defeat will mean utter ruin.
"Let every Union man stand fast in an undying faith in the power of the
Union to maintain its existence." - (8)

630 - L Aug. 25; ed:2/2 - McClellan undoubtedly will be nominated at Chi-
cago. The effort to make a great man out of him might be compared to try-
ing to make a mountain out of a mole-hill, now that he has fallen into the
hands of New York politicians who have been preserving him for several
years as the Democratic ca.ididate for president.
"Efforts to compare him with Napoleon, Washington, and other great men,
illustrate the German proverb that, 'From the sublime to the ridiculous is
only a step.'" (3)
631 - L Aug. 26; ed: 2/1 - Judge Spaulding was renominated at the Union con-
vention yesterday. His record in connection with the congressional legis-
lation of last season entitles him to the gratitude of the people in the
18th district.
"His reputation as being a champion of rights of men, as an opponent of
man-buying and man-whipping was sustained in the vigorous advocacy of rush
measures as were calculated to redeem the statute book of some of the
foulest features of legislation in this country." (4)
632 - L. Aug. 26:4/2 - The congressional convention met yesterday in Brain-
ard's hall for the purpose of nominating a candidate to Congress. It was
well attended and practically every county was represented. Judge Spauld-
ing was nominated for re-election to Congress by acclamation. Mr. Spauld-
ing was not in attendance at the convention but was informed of his re-
nomination and soon appeared to make an address.
He said: "The position of a member of Congress ought ever to be reck-
oned among the highest objects of a reasonable man's ambitions." He spoke
of having drafted a bill appropriating money for repairs of harbors on Lakes
Erie and Michigan during his first term in Congress. He expressed great
confidence in Mr. Lincoln, and asked that all Union men cast their vote for
him. Six resolutions were reported and adopted at the convention, after
which it adjourned. (32)
633 - L Aug. 26; ed:2/1 - The Chicago P0ST, predicting a very bright future
for McClellan, Fillmore, or Seymour, in case one of them wins in the Chicago
convention, implores the Democracy to nominate a "bold, fearless, and
honest man." The POST also declares that Lincoln's only hope of renomina-
tion lies in "timely and judicious declaration of martial law on election
day in New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana."
LEADER:
"We heartily disagree with the POST and predict that the Union Party
will triumph. Those who count on distraction in its ranks will be sorely
disappointed." (13)
634 - L Aug. 26; ed:2/1 - The Democratic party is imitating the tactics of
the Rebels by trying to intimidate their enemies. They expect their blus-
ter will win, but the Union party is cool and determined and will not be
intimidated and alarmed at the noise of the enemy.

"Let every Union man stand firm in his unal terable purpose to sc-
cure Union and Freedom for the whole commonwealth." - (4)
635 - L. Sept. 1; ed: 2/1 - True to predictions, McClellan was nominated
for president at the Chicago convention; George H. Pendleton, Cincin-
nati, for vice-president. -
McClellan takes credit for victories that do not rightfully belong
to him, such as the battle of Rich Mountain and others, but the only .
victory gained by him in his whole career, where he personally command-
ed, was the battle of Antietam.
"This is a brief outline of the career of 'the greatest military hum-
bug' the world ever saw, whom the Peace party has nominated as their
candidate for President: Pendleton is a third-rate lawyer and never
occupied a prominent positicn before, either in Congress or in his
party." (20)
636 - L. Sept. 1; ed:2/1 - The proposition by the Chicago convention, of
an armistice could only result in the independence of the South. The
last thing which a spirited man will do is to make a confession of having
done wrong, when he has not done so. It is humiliating to manhood and
a dangerous thing for one to ask of another. "It is none the less in-
sulting to ask of the proud and prosperous people of the North, to con-
sent to self abasement before a bitter foe, the enormity of whose crimes
are piled high before God." (14)
637 - L. Sept. 1; ed:2/2 - As has been mentioned, the real work of the
Chicago convention lay in the construction of a platform. The conven-
tion was made up of men with contradictory views on the subject of the
war, how to reconcile these conflicting views, and how to construct a
platform that the candidates would agree to support. These were the
problems to be solved. -
The result was the adoption of a platform "so confused, contradic-
tory, and indefinite upon issues of peace and war that it means nothing,
and may be interpreted to mean most anything."
The platform is a weak one, and is so full of blunders that the De-
mocracy may congratulate itself that it is no longer. Its sole thought
is hostility to the present administration and its desire to succeed to
the position which the administration holds. "We look for great dis- -
turbances and dissensions therein." (13)
638 - L. Sept. 3; ed: 1/1 - Nothing has occurred for months to assure us
of the final overthrow of the Rebellion as the result of the Chicago
convention, and Union men should realize that their duty lies in support
of their government. -
"The rebellion is tottering to a fall, and it is necessary that Union
men should realize the ineffable meanness of the Chicago reform to insure
the final and overwhelming overthrow of Copperheadism." (3)

639 - L Sept. 3; ed: 2/1 - At the Chicago Democratic convention the Ken-
tucky delegation presented a resolution, which was carried unanimously,
that McClellan should free the prisoners of war immediately on election.
"The convention had not one word to say with reference to Jeff Davis
literally starving 30,000 Union prisoners in Andersonville." (4)
640 - L Sept. 3; ed:2/1 - "The unsatisfactory nature of the Platform
adopted at Chicago becomes more apparent the more closely it is examin-
ed. It was constructed with a view to getting into power, no matter at
what expense of principles, national degradation, or dishonor." The only
declaration, in the platform that indicates a definite policy is the
resolution for the cessation of hostilities, with an ultimate convention
of the states. This would give the Rebels time to prepare new supplies
and new additions to their army, while our national debt would be in-
creased. Thus by sham it is hoped that the people will be worn out and
dispirited, finally consenting to any terms offered.
"The proposition at Chicago is shameful and ought to be repudiated
by all loyal men in the land." (17)
641 - L Sept. 6; ed:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER is making a sorry effort to
bolster up McClellan, but discovers that all the thunder it expected to
make out of arbitrary arrests, habeas corpus, the draft, etc., has all
been drawn by McClellan. It must therefore spend some time in clearing
up the "Little Corporal 's" record.
"The PLAIN DEALER has already justified the arrest of the Maryland
Legislature which is a good symptom. Believe in Arbitrary arrests to-
day, and tomorrow you can go Little Mac on Emancipation and Confiscation
which he favored!" (4)
642 - L. Sept. 6; ed: 2/1 - It is astonishing to see how the New York
NEWS, Cincinnati ENQUIRER, and the CRISIS, organs of Jeff Davis, have
accepted McClellan.
Indeed, the whole wretched litter of sniveling peace sneaks every-
where, have already made their bow to their new but hated leader, and
their policy will be to say as little about the war as possible, leav-
ing the more belligerent Democracy to laud the military course of Mc-
Clellan, while they devote themselves to Pendleton and the platform.
To all men possessing a spark of American pride, the spectacle is dis-
gusting. (8)
643 - L. Sept. 8; ed: 2/2 - The Richmond SENTINEL, commenting on "Little
Mac's" past career, suggests to him that he might reconcile his present
peace views with his former war views hy saying that the change is due
to the mismanagement of the war on the part of Mr. Lincoln.
"The SENTINEL would, undoubtedly, like to see greater distraction
than there is in the North.... As matters now stand McClellan will prob-
ably accept the Chicago nomination, but repudiate a portion of the plat-
form. Even though he be an out-and-out Peace man, he has already

discovered that the people of the North are in no mood for cringing and
crawling, and that he must deny his affiliations with such men as the
Woods and Wallandighams, if he is to have the shadow of a hope." (8)
644 - L Sept. 8; ed: 2/1 - The chief characteristics of the Chicago plat-
form are what it conceals or tries to keep in the background. The most
vital and important questions confronting the country are dodged. Dem- - -
ocratic leaders had an idea that they could mislead the people by conceal-
ing more than they revealed. They disastrously failed in this. The - - - -
people are demanding action on those points which are ignored.
The Union party condemns the Rebellion, and charges that slavery is f :
the cause and strength of the Rebellion, while the Democratic party does
not condemn the Rebellion, but speaks of the government as in the wrong,
aſid more guilty than the Rebels themselves. They also ignore slavery -
and the Negro question. "These are a few points of contrast among many
that might be made - a contrast which must ineet with the hearty appro- -
bation of Jeff Davis." - - (15)
645 - L. Sept. 9; ed: 2/2 - The final and last hope of the Rebels is to
have such a cessation of hostilities as the Democracy proposes, - that
of a convention of the States.
"It is therefore evident to every loyal man that in the re-election
of Lincoln, we have a safe guarantee of the speedy close of the war,
and his re-election will prove that the only alternative left to the
South, is to give up a hopeless struggle." (4)
646 - L. Sept. 10; ed:2/1 - McClellan's letter of acceptance is ingenious-
ly constructed and about as shamefaced as the platform on which he stands.
According to him, "the war is no longer waged for the preservation of
the Union as it should be, but ought to be managed in conformity with
certain principles which he enumerated while in active service."
"A Union in which slavery is again to become a dominant power can
never be tolerated, and the very army with which he declared sympathy,
would scorn a proposition to remand back again into slavery the hundred
thousand black men already enrolled in the army of the Union." (12)
647 - L. Sept. 10; ed:2/1 - Signs, unusually relied on in determining re-
sults of political contests, are unmistakably in favor of the great
triumph of the friends of the government at the coming election. People
are beginning to wake up to the hypocrisy of the Democrats, and will
stand by the government, "whose only policy is repression of rebellion
and establishment of the Union." . . .
"Let victory be so magnificent in its majorities, that rebellion will , -
cease in seeing the great unity of the people of the North." (9).
648 - L. Sept. 12; ed: 2/1 - McClellan's letter of acceptance is the sub-
ject of much comment, - and it is admitted that it is an evasion of the
platform. Nine days elapsed before he wrote his acceptance letter, and

during that time, he, no doubt, was thinking up some way to dodge all
disagreeable issues.
"Contrast the whiffling, balancing, hopping, shying policy of this
Democratic Son of Mars with the manly straightforward declaration of
Lincoln, and 'Unconditional Surrender' Grant. The one must command the
approval of every man who loves his country and demands its territorial
integrity. The other may win the applause of the political jugglers of
the Democratic party, and may hoodwink the unthinking and unreasoning
crowds that bow down and idolize the word Democracy." (11)
649 - L. Sept. 12; ed:2/2 - If Lincoln is reelected president, peace
will come in a short time and the Rebellion will cease. "All loyal men
should realize that the shortest road to Peace, is by keeping up an
undivided North." (4)
650 - L. Sept. 13; ed: 2/2 - McClellan says that he hopes that the views
expressed by him are the same as those of the convention.
"Already the Peace men are denouncing McClellan, and are looking
about for another candidate after efforts to wed a warrior to a plat-
form full of Peace has failed." (3)

laration for Lincoln and Johnson to a complete slate of the candidates

652 - L. Sept. 15; ed: 2/1 - Notwithstanding McClellan's many failures,
he was cheered and supported by the kindness of Lincoln and the enthu-
siasm of the country. "But all this only made his military career the

653 - L. Sept. 15; ed: 2/1 - The American people have not forgotten the
career of McClellan. He began with a reputation of accomplishing a
great work, and ended with nothing accomplished as compared with the
means and time allotted to him.
"The whole North, with a desire to make him a hero, never thought that
when he was at the head of 500,000 men, in addition to the Navy, that
he would cower before a foe for so many long months. He is asking the
American people to reward him for his want of success which can never
be done. They want no more such vacillating weakness at the head of
our armies, more anxious for the preservation of negro slavery than the
restoration of the Union." (14)
654 - L. Sept. 16; ed: 2/1, 2 - Here are some facts about George Pendleton,
candidate for vice president. He declared at one time that he would
vote for "all measures essential to sustaining the national dignity
and honor," but his votes on certain measures afterward proved that he
did not keep his word.
He voted against a bill providing increased revenue from imports,

to suppress the Rebellion. He voted against an act for the emancipa-
tion of slavery on insurrectionary districts. These, including many
other measures he voted against, "show what may be expected of him if
he is elected in November. Let the people judge between him and Abraham
Lincoln." - (30)
655 - L. Sept. 16; ed: 2/3 - Every effort is being made by the Rebels to
keep the Union from gaining more victories, and if Lincoln is elected,
they know they will be obliged to surrender.
"A while ago it was the favorite cry of the rebels that they wanted
Lincoln re-elected. There is nothing, on the contrary, they fear so . . . .

much. They know it will cnd the rebellion."
656 - L. Sept. 17; ed:2/1 - The Democratic organization says it will not
be on the defensive in the coming campaign against President Lincoln, .
but will berate the administration for things that it has done.
"Instead of defending themselves, their principles, and their candi-
dates, they are very anxious to get up capital by puffing away at arbi-
trary arrest, habeas corpus and the negro. They shiver with affright.
Poor fellows!" - - (8)
657 - L. Sept. 17; ed:2/1 - Another Democratic journal against McClellan
is "the Boston HERALD that supported Mr. Douglas in 1860 and which is
out against McClellan and his white feather platform adopted at Chicago."
- (1)
658 - L. Sept. 17; ed; 2/1 - "General McClellan privately asserts that -
he is in favor of an immediate cessation of hostilities, whiie publicly
proclaiming that he is for the war for the Union." (1)
659 - L. Sept. 17:2/1 - The Democracy has become angry over its defeat
in Vermont and Maine. Some of its organs have covered up its failure
by asserting that the issue before the people in Vermont and Maine was
not the same as the present issue with McClellan's letter of acceptance
before them. -
"The idea that Mr. McClellan, by his absurd letter acceptance,
can induce War Democrats to vote for him is absurd. With all its pro-
fessions of devotion to the Union at all hazards, the people distrust
a man who is pledged to miserable surrender to rebels in arms." - (4)
660 - L. Sept. 17; ed:2/1 - "It is said that Ben Wood has suddenly become -
enamored by the song "Ben Bolt, ' and the terrified Democracy is now
singing vociferously '0 don't you remember the letter Ben Bold.'" (1)

662 - L. Sept. 17; ed: 2/4 - Wilkes' SPIRIT in an article says that Mr.
McClellan stands today bankrupted of his chances by the victory of
General Sherman, and by the popular repudiation of his party platform.
(1)
663 - L. Sept. 18; ed:2/1 - Making his base, Mr. McClellan has been
established at Richmond. The Rebels will pray and fight for his election.
General Lee will organize all his forces to insure his election.
"It may be very disagreeable to copperheads to see what great inter-
est Jeff Davis and his rebel crew take in their success, but yet it is
so, and there is no denying it.
"The last and only hope of Mr. Davis is in the election of George
B. McClellan." (4)
664 - L. Sept. 19; ed: 2/1 - It is characteristic of people during a war
involving so much of hope and fear, for their feelings to fluctuate
from the highest point of confidence to the lowest point of despondency.
This is not the peculiarity of the North, however, and the Union men
feel confident of success in the coming election. Confidence attended
by inactivity results in defeat at times, and the Union party should
take warning and "remember that success can only be attained by constant
labor."
"The Union party must win the next two elections with such overwhelm-
ing majorities that the rebels will forever resign all hope of breaking
up the Republic. Let the spirit which now animates our ranks be main-
tained to the end." (7)
665 - L. Sept. 20; ed: 2/2 - "The Democracy defiantly shakes McClellan's
letter of acceptance, as an Indian does his war club, when the Peace-
at-any-price Platform is referred to. He has sworn to maintain the
Union, a sentiment which is very becoming for the 'Little Mackerals'
but the value of which is destroyed by the class of men who surround
him, and who would govern him in case he is elected."
"Pendleton and McClellan are not pulling together as can be seen
from Pendleton's statement concerning McClellan's order for the arrest
of the legislature of Maryland, which he terms 'the greatest invasion
of State Sovereignty that has taken place.' They also do not agree
upon the subject of drafting, etc.
"Nothing but a base surrender of the South could result in McCellan's
being surrounded by such advisers as Pendleton, Woods, and Seymour." (19)
666 - L. Sept. 21; ed:2/2 - A cessation of hostilities, as the Chicago
convention advocates, would result in negotiations carried along for
perhaps years, resulting only in separation in the end. "The only way
in which the Union can be restored is to fight on until the rebels lay
down their arms. This is the only pre-requisite of Peace which the
Union demands." (4)

667 - L. Sept. 22; ed: 2/2 - McClellan, has two classes of supporters:
One a genuine "Copperhead" who rants about the Chicago platform, and
another, who ignores the platform but tries to protest that McClellan
is for war for the Union. "Thus, by riding a War horse and a Peace
horse, they imagine they will ride into power." (2)
668 - L. Sept. 23; ed:2/1 - The New York WORLD is so foolish as to urge
the victory of Sherman as another reason why there should be a Democratic
president, claiming that the problems to be solved are so weighty, that
they should be passed on to Little Mac. "The people do not see it in
that light. On the contrary, the victory brings the day of honorable
peace nearer and nearer." (2)
669 - L. Sept. 24; ed: 2/1 - Pendleton has uttered very few words since
his nomination. "What secret motives have the Copperheads for keeping
Pendleton in the background. It is a thing unheard of in Presidential
nominations. The peace sneaks hope to achieve through Pendleton what
they are not sure of reaching through Little Mac.
"It is necessary to have one adulterated secessionist on the list
of candidates, so Pendleton was nominated. It won't do for him to utter
a word of devotion to the Union. He must be ready for the nefarious
scheme of Belmont, the Jew and owner of the Democratic party." (7)
670 - L. Sept. 24; ed:2/1 - With General Fremont's resignation, the arena
of politics is now occupied by two individuals, Lincoln and McClellan.
Fremont declares that the reason Lincoln did not keep the North united
is because he did not smite slavery as frequently and powerfully as
Fremont thinks he might have done.
"Lincoln's Administration has been a success by reason of that care-
ful policy which he has pursued, and by which slavery will become a dead
thing never to be revitalized in the South." (11)
671 - L. Sept. 26; ed:2/1 - "When the Baltimore Convention passed the
resolution to the effect that it was 'Deemed essential to the general
welfare that harmony should prevail in the National Council," etc., Mr.
Blair applied the resolution to himself, and... promptly tendered his
resignation to the President, to be accepted whenever he, the President,
should see fit.
... "The New York HERALD understands that Mr. Blair has taken this step
to be at liberty to stump the border States for Lincoln and Johnson."
(6)
672 - L. Sept. 29; ed:2/2 - The Philadelphia PRESS says that Senator Wall
of New Jersey declares that if the Democrats lose at the November elec-
tion, McClellan will "place himself at the head of a million men and by
virtue of military power, declare himself President of the United
States." -
"As Senator Wall hails from the same state as McClellan, he should
know whereof he speaks." (2)

673 - L. Sept. 29; ed: 2/2 - The New York WORLD says that Pendleton has
always pursued a policy best adapted to the welfare of the country,
meaning that the wisest policy is that of recognizing the right of a
state to secede. "If there are any war Democrats who think that McClellan
is a war man, they had better surrender all ideas of this kind, and
recognize the fact that McClellan and Pendleton are both Copperheads." (3)
674 - L. Sept. 30; ed: 2/1 - The overwhelming defeat of Wallandigham last
fall gave people the opportunity to say that votes had been imported.
Now that Indiana shows evidence of Union majorities, the TIMES intimates
that votes are to be imported. The pretense that fraud is employed
will do to cover up such an inglorious defeat as the Democrats will
suffer. "It is simply one of those political howlings which make it
evident that despair is settling down upon our political adversaries." (3)
675 - L Oct. 3; ed:4/4 - Mr. Jerome, manager of the Soldiers home,
kept a register of the votes of soldiers stopping there. After a week
or more it became so monotonous, that he gave it up in disgust. It was
like playing at "sparking" alone. Soldiers were so unanimous for Lincoln
that Jerome juight as well have been chewing gum, so far as profit is
concerned, as taking votes. "How Mac does run in the Army! Like a
crab, backwards!" (2)
676 - L Oct. 4:2/2 - Senator Wade and Henry Winter Davis have both
taken the stump for the reelection of Lincoln and are "throwing into the
Canvass all the vigor and power which has always characterized their
efforts. We are glad to see them both conquering personal preferences
and entering thus heartily into the great work to which their duty to
their country calls them." (10)
677 - L Oct. 5; ed: 2/1 - George W. Curtis has been nominated for congress-
man in the first district in New York. "If elected, he will prove to
be a specimen of a cultivated literary mind applying itself to the
great work of counseling in regard to our country and succeeding admir-
ably therein. We welcome him to politics and hope he will be elected." (2)
678 - L Oct. 5; ed: 2/3 - "We are assured by men who have been in
Pennsylvania, that Union men are all ablaze with enthusiasm for Lincoln
and the Unicn. The cause is gaining daily, and thousands of Democrats
who have heretofore opposed Lincoln, are now his support." (2)
679 - L. Oct. 8; ed: 2/2 - Democratic leaders generally regard the Irish
population as belonging to them "body and soul and breaches."
"If we are not mistaken, this Democratic pretension to the owner-
ship of the Irish vote will be belied and thousands of Irishmen will
be on the side of the Union and Abraham Lincoln." (4)

680 - L. Oct. 11; ed: 2/1, 2 - It is a true saying that a man is known by
the company he keeps, and whatever he may say to the contrary, his
strongest affiliations, sympathies, tastes, lie in the direction of his
daily associates.
So it is with McClellan. Efforts may be made to redeem his character,
but so long as he associates with questionable company, so long is he
himself to be suspected. Men like Belmont, agent in this country for
Rothschilds, and Wallandigham, an outlawed traitor, are McClellan's
companions. Deserters and Rebel refugees in Canada are anxious for
his election. -
Can any man doubt, knowing what principles he has, and who his as-
sociates are, that he is unfit for the grave and responsible duties of
President of the United States? "Being in such poor company he will be
beaten as was his prototype, poor dog Tray." - (21)
681 - L Oct. 13; ed:2/2 - In view of the recent victories gained in
Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania, it is proposed that Union-loving people
of Cleveland and surrounding towns get together and celebrate. "Let us
give expression to our feelings of joy that our people are not devoid
of self respect and honor and that they are still determined to put
down the rebellion even if it takes the last dollar and the last man.
Let us be joyful that the peace sneaks are few and far between, and
that our glorious Union shall be restored to its pristine splendor." (6)
682 - L Oct. 15; ed: 2/2 - The Democratic press, knowing that their
party is beaten at the polls, are forced to keep up their courage by
resorting to a system of unscrupulous lies. Among others they claim
that McClellan, will be elected in November when he has already been
beaten. "Lying cannot elect McClellan, for the people have heard the
news." . . . (5)
683 - L. Oct. 18; ed:2/1 - The PLAIN DEALER says: "We have every reason
to believe that the vote of the army of the Potomac has gone Democratic."
Give the reason and your readers will be saved the necessity of gulping
down a naked lie. Some years ago certain of the faithful who follow
the shammy light of the PLAIN DEALER lost money by putting faith in its
fiction, and betting accordingly. Is the PLAIN DEALER desirous of doing
them a similar wrong? (2)
684 - L. Oct. 20; ed:2/1 - "We see no indications as yet from Columbus
that the state is to be thoroughly aroused with great meetings between
this time and Nov. 8. If it is their opinion that no work of this
kind needs to be done, they are mistaken. We need to roll up a large
majority next month, and the moral effect of overwhelming success, the
effect of a hearty enthusiasm in this State, will have its effect in
other States." (3)

685 - L Oct. 20; ed: 2/1 - The Richmond ENQUIRER says that for 20 years,
as Pennsylvania has gone, so has the presidential election, but that even
though it has gone Republican, there is hope for the Rebels. "That is
only the view of the ENQUIRER and its friends in the North. We do not
believe this would change the unalterable purpose of the people to elect
Abraham Lincoln and stand by the Union." (5)
686 - L Oct. 20; ed: 2/3 - There is nothing on which the Democrats like
to harp so much as on the inconsistencies of Lincoln. They assert that
he has changed the purpose of the war and that his inconsistencies have
been so many that Democrats who supported him in the beginning of the
war can no longer do so.
"The real reasons why they oppose Lincoln, is because he enforces a
draft, and they bitterly denounce this methcq of raising troops. They
also lament about habeas corpus and arbitrary arrests, but forget that
McClellan arrested the Maryland Legislature by force. Thus he proved
that such arrests are sometimes justified and necessary."
In all these things McClellan is inconsistent, while Lincoln maintains
his policy throughout. (12)
687 - L. Oct. 24; ed: 2/1 - The tide of popular feeling having turned
against Pendleton, efforts are being made to cover up his "Copperhead"
record by making the declaration that he is in favor of the Union.
"A few words of devotion for the Union will have no effect, after his
infamous career of three years, but that of adding hypocrisy... to his
other vices." (3)
688 - L. Oct. 25; ed: 2/1 - In two weeks the people of these states will
decide between peace and war. Every indication signifies that war shall
continue until the armed Rebellion is crushed. The Democratic leaders
are planning on laying a trap to catch the unwary and unthinking. All
the devices of politicians at the North and Rebels at the South will be
resorted to, to influence public opinion.
"No one need be deceived by these tricks. The Chicago platform wants
a convention with a view to restoration of the Union. Stevens, Boyce,
and Johnson favor a convention between equal powers, but do not mention
restoration of the Union.
"By acknowledging independence of the South, we justify England and
France in similar recognition, sure to follow such an act on the part of
the North. We justify them in breaking the blockade, we barter away
our nationality, and we consent to a broken, dismembered Union. If we
wish to avert these evils, we must stand by the Union. The people are not
silly gudgeons thus to be caught." (18)
689 - L. Oct. 26; ed:2/2 - After elections in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Indiana are over and the "Copperheads" see nothing but defeat ahead, they
have Pendleton write a letter saying he is "opposed to any course of policy
which will defeat the re-establishment of the government on its old

"These hypocritical pretensions made at the last moment, can't save
him from the political hanging he deserves." (3)
690 - L Oct. 28:4/3 - The Union meeting held last night in Brainard's
hall was a most gratifying success. James Mason, Esq., presided. Col.
Edward F. Noyes of the 39th Ohio regiment was introduced as the first
speaker. He touched upon the origin of the war, and distinctly proved .
that the war was commenced long before Lincoln became President. He
proceeded to picture the desolation which the madness of the South had
brought about. His eulogy and defense of Lincoln was greeted with the
wildest enthusiasm and applause. - - -
J. H. Rhodes, Esq., closed the meeting with a very vigorous and
eloquent speech, and made a powerful appeal to the people to rally in
their might at the coming election. The influence of this meeting will
be felt at the polls by an increase in the Union majority of from 800 . .
to 1,500. -- (16)
691 - L. Oct. 28; ed: 2/1 - A most astounding fraud has come to light
in connection with the New York soldiers' votes. In Baltimore sealed .
envelopes containing the votes of the New York soldiers were opened
and McClellan votes substituted for Lincoln votes. "This shows how much
faith the 'Copperheads' have in the soldiers votes, and to what desperate
efforts they are ready to resort in order to carry the election for . -
McClellan." - - . (3)
692 - L. Oct. 29; ed: 2/2 - The attempt to rob New York soldiers of their
Union votes is made because they are so uniformly for Lincoln, . . . .
"When soldiers repudiate sham Democracy, it is not surprising that
the ballot box stuffers endeavor to rob them of the right to vote." (3)
693 - L Oct. 29; ed:2/2 - The character of this modern Democracy is
well exhibited in the revolutionary appeals of their newspapers and
speakers. They declare that if they do not succeed in this election,
it must be fraud, and that a resolution will be justifiable. "An over-
whelming defeat on Nov. 8 will silence the snakes." (2)
694 - L Nov. 1:2/1 - "No man can justify himself before God or before
his own conscience, for remaining an idle spectator of the great polit-
ical struggle now going on in this country. Neutrality at such time
as this is nothing but service in the lines of the enemies of the Re-
public.
"We therefore invoke every man who contemplates being an idle observer
of this contest, to revise his decision and cast his vote for Lincoln
and the Union." - (6)

695 - L Nov. 1; ed: 2/2 - The words spoken by President Lincoln to
citizens of Maryland show that reverence for law and the will of the
people constitute the only security against Rebellion.
"If the majority of the people of this country insist upon transfer
of the Government into hands of men who will barter away its integrity
and its freedom, there is nothing to restrain them from this fatal
crime." (4)
696 - L Nov. 1:4/3-5 - Honorable Salmon P. Chase addressed an audience at
the Union meeting held in Brainard's hall last night. He was introduced
by Judge Spaulding. He began his speech by reviewing the time when he
first came to Ohio to go to school and gives credit to the schools and
freemen of Ohio for making him what he is.
He spoke of the fact that in the midst of so great a war as this we
are able to conduct a presidential election. "It fills me with gratitude
to think that I am a citizen of a republic in which so great a spectacle
is possible."
He discussed the candidates for election and reelection and also
the conditions of the Chicago platform. Of Lincoln he said: "No one
doubts that he is sincerely and earnestly in favor of the maintenance
of the Union of the States, and that he will do all he can to preserve
the Union. The intentions of the candidates, the platform and people
of the Union party are unmistakable." -
Chase then spoke at length of the opposing party and declared that
no matter what course the Democrats pursue in order to defeat the Union
and its principles, it is a settled question in the minds of the people
that Lincoln will be reelected by a greater majority than was ever
given before in a contested election, and declared that the election of
the candidates of the opposing party is utterly hopeless.
He closed with a plea that "every man, and every woman here, may
lay to heart the importance of the great issues before us, and of their
right decision; that each may consider how far these issues reach into
time, and what immense results they will influence, and that each one
may give every energy in seeing that the last voter is brought out, for
the success of our holy cause." (62)
697 - L Nov. 1; ed: 2/2 - We do not believe that the masses of the
Democracy would themselves entertain the idea of a Rebellion, but his-
tory shows that wicked leaders precipitate their followers into open
resistance to constituted authority. "Let these wicked men be thorough-
ly defeated and results will be that these revolutionary tendencies
will cease." (2)
698 - L. Nov. 2; ed: 2/2 - Now that Governor Seymour and his friends have
been convicted of such gigantic crimes against New York soldiers as rob-
bing them of their votes, they try to escape the wrath of the people
by making a great noise about the frauds in Indiana. "But this will
not help them. The people in New York are becoming thoroughly alive
to the schemes of these Democratic party leaders." (2)

Lincoln shall be the next President.
"The election of candidates of the opposition party is hopeless, but
overconfidence will not do even in Ohio. The people must go to work . . .
if the high character of the State is to be maintained." (2)
700 - L Nov. 3; ed:2/2 - The revelations made concerning the conspiracy
of New York politicians to defraud soldiers of their votes is one of
the greatest crimes against the purity and freedom of the ballot box and
every one who engaged in it, no matter what his position in life, should
be punished to the full extent of the law. Imprisonment for life is not
too severe. "The safety of our free institutions, the very life of the
nation itself, depends on a faithful expression of a popular will."
(7)
701 - L Nov. 3:4/3-5 - The Hon. Lyman Tremain and the Hon. Samuel -
Galloway addressed a large and enthusiastic audience that met in
Brainard's hall last night. Mr. Tremain discussed the issues involved
in the present campaign. In discussing the attitude of the people to-
ward the Rebellion, he said: "The will of our people is as fixed as
the laws of the Medes and Persians; they have resolved that this nation
shall live and this accursed rebellion shall die." He contended there
can be no right of revolution under a representative government, and we
can "right all wrongs by ballot, not by bullet."
The speaker also challenged an answer to the question, "What act of
oppression has the Federal Government ever put upon the south?" He
gave the history of Calhoun's disunion projects and measures. It has
been said that the war is a failure. This was very vigorously denied
by Mr. Tremain, who said that "it has been of unparalleled success."
He closed his remarks by saying: "We must fight this war through, wipe
out slavery, and crush the Chicago platform. We have always been
compromising with slavery; we had better settle it forever by putting
it in the grave."
Samuel Galloway commenced his speech by remarking the fact that Mr.
Tremain, formerly a Democrat, and he himself once a Whig, stood on the
same platform. He showed how the Union question had fused all parties
into one. Speaking of the war, he said that every man and woman had an
equal interest in its "great and glorious issue - the humblest soldier
as well as the President." He stated that if the Rebellion goes down,
the Union will be restored, "not the old Union, but a new and glorious
Union, robed in the attributes of God and the characteristics of an en-
lightened Christianity." He dwelt upon the fact that we were fighting
for emancipation of both races - the poor whites of the South as well
as the blacks. He referred to the historical fact that the Union was
most earnestly sought by the South and had always protected slavery.
He made very elegant closing remarks, saying: "We shall soon hear
the voice of liberty echoing and re-echoing throughout the land...."

who hoped by the art of forgery to carry the state for McClellan,
must realize that the government knows what it is doing and will
not be cowed by New York bullies. The arrest of three men who
took part in this forgery will likely have a wholesome effect upon
New York politics. "Democracy has gained but little in trying to
carry its schemes by fraud." (4)
703 - L Nov. 5:4/3 - A Union meeting was held in Newburgh town hall last
night. The glee club, composed of young men and women of Newburgh
Heights, furnished music for the occasion. John G. Grannis was the main
speaker of the evening. He showed conclusively that the supporters of
the Chicago nominees were the peace men, and those in favor of surrender
to the Rebels. He said that an armistice was what the Rebels wanted.
Commenting on the emancipation proclamation, he declared it one of the
wisest acts of the administration. (11)

on the war, he will not be true to his principles and the Chicago Plat-
form if he does not drive 150,000 negro soldiers out of the army and
order a draft for 150,000 white men to fill their places." (1)
705 - L Nov. 8; ed: 2/2 - The men who drew up the Chicago platform have
tried for weeks to convince the American people that its acceptance
did not demand a base surrender of the manhood of the nation.
The people felt, however, that they would merit their own self con-
tempt if they accepted it. "But umble pie is too humble for the diges-
tion of the American people. They therefore very wisely spurn the
proffered dish and demand the unconditional submission of the rebels." (4)
706 - L Nov. 8; ed: 2/2 - The presence of the much-hated Butler in New
York city with 10,000 troops will influence Rebel refugees and "Copper-
heads" who propose to control the polls on election day.
"If it means riot, we trust Belmont, Barlow and Marbel, of the World
fraternity, will have a good taste of the old beast Butler before he
returns to super intend his Dutch Gap canal and assist in the taking of
Richmond." - (6)
707 - L Nov. 8; ed: 2/3 - The PLAIN DEALER announces that the torch
light procession, which was to have sent terror into the hearts of Union
men, was withdrawn because of inclement weather. "The balmy air and
light moon last night gave the lie to the excuse. The fact of the
matter is, they had torches but not enough men to carry them." (2)
708 - L Nov. 9; ed:4/3 - We spent some time in the office of the PLAIN
DEAL ER last night and witnessed a dismal scene as election returns came
in. The crowd was enthusiastic at first with expectations of McClellan's
victory, but soon they started slipping out as returns showed that the
Union party was leading. (11)

Abstracts 709 - 714
ELECTIONS, CAMPAIGNS &amp; CANDIDATES - United States (Cont'd)
709 - L Nov. 10; ed:2/3 - Our triumph signified that a decided majority
of people have sworn that the Union shall be maintained, and that armed
Rebels shall have no cessation of hostilities until they lay down their
arms and return to their allegiance. The election will signify to
Europe that the republic is more powerful than ever, and is strong
enough to maintain its integrity against foreign foes, (5)
710 - L Nov. 12; ed: 2/1 - The recent victory of the people should not
be regarded as a party triumph over another party, but should be con-
sidered a vindication of the ability of a free people to govern them-
selves. The election proves that the people of the North are unflinch-
ing in their opposition to the dissolution of the Union. "We hail the
recent election, therefore, as a great victory for the people, not for
a party." - (6)
711 - L Nov. 14; ed: 2/1 - November 8 marks the climax and conclusion
of McClellan's career, "a career over which from beginning to end, is
written the words which his followers wanted to inscribe on our Nation-
al banner - Failure." -
The resignation of McClellan shows a tardy sense cf justice, as it
is two years since he was removed from command. The sense of the infamy
of his position has at last forced itself upon his mind. "It is lucky
for him that his last public act is his best, and that being forced to
make his exit from public life, he retires in as graceful a manner as
possible." (12)
712 - L Nov. 18; ed: 2/2 - The effect of the overwhelming triumph of
the Union in the recent election has quieted the feverish hostility to
the war. It is a good thing that the majority are on the side of the
Union, and that the men who have been plotting treason have had their
plans defeated. "Let the government only use the splendid courage of
the people as it should and the rebellion will receive a most ruinous
defeat." (5)
713 - L Dec. 1; ed:2/1 - Friends of McClellan will be glad to learn that
after his military and political career have both been concluded in disgra :e-
ful failure, he has found a positicn as engineer-in-chief of the Morris and
Essex railroad. His salary is $25,000 a year - the same salary he would
have received had he been elected president of the United States.
"Financially, therefore, lie is 'even' - and he has the satisfaction
of knowing that he will give infinitely better satisfaction to his
employers in his present position than he would have done in the one to
which he aspired." - - (3)
714 - L Dec. 8; ed:2/1 - The President rightly interprets the election
when he says that it "gave evidence that the people were unchanged in
their determination to stand by the Union and the Constitution. With
the exception of a few "Copperheads" the people are united in this one
thing. The Union is to be restored, by peaceful means if possible, by
war if necessary." (3)

ELECTIONS, CAMPAIGNS &amp; CANDIDATES - United States (Cont'd)
715 - L. Dec. 14; ed: 2/2 - The rotten-borough legislation of old Virgin-
ia in session at Alexandria has elected Joseph Segar, and John C. Under-
wood. "We hope these two men will not be permitted to take their seats
in the senate. They are not true representatives of West Virginia. They
were not elected by the regularly organized legislature and their so-
called state has no Union government.... The whole affair is a piece cf
rotten-borough legislation as shameless as that of the 'Old Sarum'
borough of the English House of Commons." (6)

ENGLAND
716 - L. Feb. 2; ed: 2/1 - In England the welfare of the nation and man-
kind depends largely upon the character and sex of the first baby in
the royal household. The first report of the baby weighing nine pounds
was untrue. The little prince is happy and well. Everyone trusts that
he has inherited largely of the virtues of his royal grandmother, Wic-
toria. This is the third time that sovereigns of the House of Hanover
have seen a child born to succeed to their honors. "Wictoria's heir
and grandchild comes into this busy world of ours with no antinatal
family jars. Let us hope well for the new prince." (17)
717 - L. Feb. 24; ed: 2/1 - In England by a law of primogeniture, when
a man dies intestate, his real-estate goes to his oldest son instead
of the heirs. "It will readily be seen how in a few years, the entire
land of England has become property of a very small minority." (7)
718 - L. Feb. 25; ed: 2/1 - The temper of the English parliament is not
very sweet just now. They occupy neutrality now which is liable to be
broken up by conflicting forces. "It may require almost miraculous
wisdom and foresight to keep England from drifting out of her armed
neutrality into War." (7)
ENGRAVING &amp; ENGRAWERS
719 - L. Apr. 2; adv:4/3 - B. S. Green is the agent for the finest steel
engraving in Cleveland. The engraving is a portrait of Grant, and in
each corner it has pictures of happenings in his life. (3)

EUROPE
763 - L. Feb. 5; ed:2/1 - "There is a logic of events by which nations
are set adrift toward results which they scarcely anticipate. Cabinets
and Parliaments, Congresses and Secretaries assume high moral ground, and
being unable to retreat from their positions without dishonor, the con-
sequence is, they are precipitated into a fearful struggle.
"We hope to be disappointed, but it scarcely seems possible now for
the calamity of a European War to be averted. The nations are all
silently drifting toward the dreaded result." (18)
764 - L. Mar. 11; ed:2/2 - Austrians and Prussians with bold leadership
in the Denmark war force the Danes out of Schleswig and Holstein and
even invade north into Denmark.
The English government calls a peace conference. "It is certainly
the part of wisdom for England to adopt this method of getting out of
difficulty in which she becomes involved. It would be a rash commit-
ment of herself to the support of tie Danes." (12)
765 - L July 14; ed: 2/1 - When time London conference, which assembled
to make harmony between Germany and Denmark, adjourned, the English
press was in favor of war against Germany and favoring Denmark. From
the beginning of the German war, the English government has threatened
until time for action; then it has backed down. "England is right in
trying to avoid war, as she would expose her merchantmen to droves of
Alabamas, but her cowardice is subject for laughter and disgust." - (5)
766 - L. Aug. 10; ed: 2/2 - "The most engrossing subject of comment in
Europe at the present time, is the Congress just assembled at Vienna,
with a view to a peaceable settlement of the Dano-German difficulties.
"If Denmark consents to a union with German states, she becomes the
northern outlet for the commerce of fifty million people. She has a
mighty people to sustain her, and hope of distinct nationality.
"The problem grows more interesting and important." (5)

holy alliance is consummated between Russia, Germany, and Austria for
the purpose of checking the progress of France and England.
"Such an alliance as this may hasten a general European war, as it
touches such vital interests." (3)
768 - L Aug. 25; ed: 2/3 - The Danish war, just closed, seems to Americans
like a very small affair, but before our own war broke out we would have
looked upon it with horror
"Denmark fought bravely and well and inflicted sore damage on Germany
even though Germany with the aid of Austria and Prussia won." (4)

Marshal Murray on a charge of kidnapping. He was previously engaged

will be whether or not international law authorizes a sovereign or state
to deliver to another, criminal subjects of the latter irrespective of
any treaty." . (6)

EXTRADITION (Cont'd)
774 - L June 4; ed: 2/1 - The captain general of Cuba gave thanks to
President Lincoln for sending back the slave trader Arguel les, who was
captured in the United States. This has occasioned great anxiety to
the professed "Radical Democracy" in their recent convention.
"Is it not pitiful - This spectacle of a wretched slave trader cham-
pioned by these most radical of radicals - his arrest, which has already
produced such beneficial results, denounced as an outrage upon liberty."
- - (7)
775 - L June 9; ed: 2/4 - The New York TIMES expresses sympathy with the
Arguelles case. America can produce scoundrels of her own without im-
porting them.
"We add that the sympathy of the Copperheads with Arguelles is per-
fectly consistent, and correspondent with the fitness of things." (2)

933 - L. Jan. 14; ed:2/3 - The New York TIMES states that President Lin-
coln's popularity has advanced through Europe. His maintenance of the
act of emancipation in his annual message gave immense satisfaction to
many.
"Mr. Lincoln will merit more than a biography, he will merit a his-
tory." (4)
934 - L. Jan. 27; ed:2/2 - The people will read with gratification
Seward's dispatches to Adams, our minister at London, touching our rela-
tions with England. Their calm, firm, and decided tone and the grave
warnings which they convey to the English government express the senti-
ments of the American people. Seward says that the United States shall
protect itself against armed cruisers from Great Britain, and insist
upon indemnities for injuries which expeditions have committed, and the
navy of the United States shall receive instructions to pursue enemies.
We feel that in these extracts there is a calm, earnest, dignified warm-
ing, which is more impressive than empty vaporings. (6)
935 - L. Feb. 22; ed:2/3 - Secretary Seward makes a claim for damages
done to our commerce by the ship ALABAMA in its piratical voyages on
the high seas. The London TIMES wrote a bullying editorial on this
subject saying Seward has to prove the extent of damage. It claims
England cannot be made liable for American property losses of millions.
"England may as well understand now that these claims are to be
settled. The American people will approve of these demands." (4)
936 - L. Mar. 3; ed: 2/1 - Seward's note of July 11, 1863 to Adams has
been the subject of recent discussion in parliament and is likely to be
of considerable importance. Seward warns England in his letter that
"The United States will protect itself and its commerce against armed
cruisers if they have to enter British ports to do it."
"We believe, however, that the good sense of the rulers of England
will not allow the people to be twitted into a War with the United
States." (15)

English 'neutrality' will le exhausted." (7)
938 - L Oct. 8; ed:2/2 - News of Union triumphs have caused consterna-

Republic ill, all who hate to see Democratic institutions provirg their
stability in such a crisis as this, all who wish to see slavery re-
established, are in favor of the election of McClellan. On the other
hard, all the liberal thinkers of Europe, men who hate slavery and wish
to see republicanism live forever, are anxious for the re-election of
Lincoln. -

Border Raids
941 - L. Nov. 5; ed:2/1 - It is becoming more evident that the followers
and sympathizing friends of Jeff Davis now in Canada are at work along
the northern frontier and are trying to bring about a state of border war-
fare between the United States and Canada. "These border raids may just-
ly be regarded as among the symptoms of those desperate paroxysms which
precede the utter dissolution of organized rebellion. We trust the Gov-
ernment will deal with them as it deals with rebellion in the South.
This is not a time for a hesitating or doubting policy." (15)
942 - L. Dec. 15; ed: 2/1 - Much has been said about British and Canadian
sympathy with the Rebellion. The decision made in the case of the St.
Albans raiders is outrageous and has aroused the indignation of the
people. These robbers and cutthroats, through the judge's decision were
permitted to go free and unpunished. "Never was there a grosser and more
flagrant insult offered to our nation. The time is coming, however, when
the Canadian authorities who now abet and sympathize with robbery, arson,
and murder will be compelled to make restitution a hundredfold." (4)

FOREIGN RELATIONS - Boarder Raids (Cont'd) -
943 - L Dec. 16; ed: 2/1 - The reported sensation in Canada over the re-
lease of the St. Albans raiders is an excellent example of diplomacy.
"We predict that the judge who rendered the decision will be retained
in office and the raiders will never be recaptured. Meanwhile the de-
nunciation in Canada of this act tho' insincere, shows that its out-
rageous character is appreciated even there." (3)
944 - L Dec. 19, ed:2/2 - Order No. 97 issued by General Dix, relating
to the pursuit of raiders into neutral territory, has been revoked be-
cause of the disapproval of the President.
"Short-lived as this order has been, it has most effectually accom-
plished the cause for which it was issued. Taken in connection with
the prompt action of Congress in terminating the Reciprocity Treaty,
and in placing proper naval armament on the lakes, it has convinced
the Canadian Authorities that the Government and people of the United
States were no longer to be trifled with." (12)
945 - L Dec. 21; ed:2/1 - The release of the St. Albans raiders by the
Canadian authorities has caused great excitement in Canada and the
United States. The order of General Dix, authorizing military officers
to pursue and capture the raiders, was applauded by the press in most
cases. "These facts are evidence beyond all doubt that Canada has
learned to respect the Republic, and to tremble in anticipation of its
righteous vengeance." - (8)
946 - H Dec. 27; ed: 2/2 - Our Canadian neighbors are shielding and
honoring Confederates who have fled from the South.
"We trust our government is wide awake to the wrongs we have suffer-
ed from Canada. There is no more excuse for our Canadian neighbors
than an individual who... secretes a criminal...." Canada, in this, plays
the fool as well as the knave... for she ought to know that once the
riot of war enters in her territory, she falls from the parent tree
like mellow fruit.... "Nations cannot let each other alone, for the
acts of individuals grow into national offenses. We hope, however,
that Canada is opening her eyes to the situation; and is coming to be of
better mind." (17)
947 - H Dec. 29; ed:4/1 - There have been Canadian movements to suppress
contemplated raids on the U. S. frontier.
"The St. Albans raiders...have been rearrested and sent to Montreal.
Probably they will not find another Judge Coursal." (4)

949 - L. Jan. 21; ed: 2/1 - His supreme highness is about to leave France
with reinforcements for French soldiers in Mexico, to take control of
that government. Referring to Duke Maximilian, "We would advise, if
you value the peace and dignity of your old age or the honor of your
posterity, that you tack about with your ships and your reinforcements.
before you get in sight of these ill-fated shores and spend the few
years you have left, not as a short lived King of a tropical Empire, but .
as a good sailcron the rattling Adriatic." (13).
950 - L Feb. 13; ed:2/2 - News from Mexico asserts the triumph of .
French arms is complete. The Mexican republic ceases to exist and a . .
monarchy is established. "France and the rebels will be pleased with
this intelligence, but the Republic can afford to wait a little longer."

951 - L Apr. 5; ed: 2/1 - The Monroe doctrine is to be vindicated. The .
United Stated is unwilling to tolerate a monarchical government in
Mexico. "We hold to the doctrine that this Western Continent is to be ..
planted with democracies, not with monarchy." (10)
952 - L Apr. 7: ed: 2/2 - Maximilian is to ascend the Mexican throne and . . . . .
observe neutrality toward the United States. "Louis Napoleon's neutral-
ity and coldness towards the rebels is partially explained by his desire
to see Maximilian securely established on the Mexican throne." . (5).
953 - L. Apr. 7; ed:2/2 - An English journal thinks Napoleon has made
wonderful progress in Mexico and that danger of armed interference on
the part of the United States, is the only obstacle in the way of
France's complete possession. "The American people do not believe in
the consolidation of Mexico under Napoleon, and will make decided ob-
jections to it, now or otherwise." - (5).
954 - L. Apr. 8; ed: 2/2 - Sumner, chairman on foreign relations in the
Senate, in his Cooper institute speech, took even stronger ground than
is expressed in the resolution against knuckling to Napoleon. "Napoleon
will now understand the temper of the people of this country; Mexico - -
cannot be the colony of an European Monarch." (4) .

"During the sixteen years he has ruled over the French nation, he has
had a definite line of policy which he has pursued with a constancy and
purpose that prove him possessed of the first qualities of genius....
His foreign policy has always had reference to strengthening the papacy
and enlarging the area of French Colonial power.... Ever since Canada
was lost to the French, it has been an object with that ambitious people
to establish a colony upon this Western continent. The rebellion offer-
ed an opportunity to carry out this dream of French conquest. Mexico
was consequently invaded, and now having been partially conquered,
Maximilian... has been transformed into Emperor Max the First.
"The question now is, what shall be the attitude of the Federal
Government toward the new Empire? There is no mistaking the issue. We
must either maintain the Monroe doctrine or back down from it until the
rebellion is over, when a hundred thousand restless soldiers of the Re-
public will take possession of Mexico, in behalf of the United States
of America.
"We are not surprised at the manner in which the organs of the
English aristocracy acquiesce in the ambitious plans of Napoleon. The
London TIMES of April 12th declares that the apology offered by the
Emperor Napoleon for invading and occupying Mexico is sufficient....
The TIMES seems especially gratified with the idea that the progress
of the Anglo-Saxon race upon this continent has been greatly impeded
by this occupation of Mexico.
"These schemes of the Emperor are no doubt aggravating, but we must
bide our time and subordinate all side issues to the suppression of the
rebellion." (12)
956 - L. May 28; ed:2/2 - The President directed Dayton, our minister to
France, to inform the government of France that he does not at present
contemplate any departure from the policy which this government has
pursued in regard to the war which exists between France and Mexico.
"Let us first restore the Union, and then invite Maximilian, with
charging bayonettes, if need be, to retire to Austria with his French-
men and leave Mexico alone." (9)
957 - L. June 17; ed:2/2 - Maximilian and his wife landed in Mexico,
represented by the French to be the choice of the people of Mexico. If
they expected demonstrations upon their arrival they must surely have
been disappointed.
"A few more weeks will show the character of the French designs, and
the day cannot be far distant, when French intervention will be met by
American protests, more significant than the adoption of resolutions
by Congress or by any political conventions." (7)
958 - L June 18; ed:2/2 - The Paris correspondent of the London TIMES
writes that the French government has sent two delegates to America to
ascertain by personal inspection the real estate, and to report thereon

959 - L Dec. 20; ed:2/1 - "Foreign advices represent that France is in a
state of ferment over the prospect that Juarez will issue letters of

destruction of American merchantmen by rebel pirates, encouraged and

business firms fell for the racket, resulting in their being swindled
out of $4,000 or $5,000. These men have now disappeared. (10)

979 - L Aug. 2; ed: 2/1 - "There has been no better symptom of a healthy
growth of public opinion than the progress which has been made within
the few years past in the cultivation of athletic games."
The time has come when people are beginning to realize that a strong
healthy athletic body is just as important as a cultivated mind. It is
impossible for a strong mind to function properly if attached to a puny,
weak body. -
Within the past ten years much interest has been shown on the question
of making sound minds in sound bodies. Sich progress has been made, that
all schools, whether high school, academy, or college, are decidedly
behind the times without some physical education.
Ball playing is fast becoming one of the fire arts in many educational
institutions in the east. To be a good baseball or cricket player, is
to enjoy honors equal to those bestowed on a valedictorian.
Provisions should be made in Cleveland enabling women and girls to
learn swimming. "If we could have our views realized, we should have
bathing houses on the lake shore to enable all classes to learn the art
of swimming. Let us, as a people, encourage athlctic games and sports."

between the North and the South. He defended the Northern people's
stand against slavery, and urged continuance of the war until it is
wiped out. "It is in fact a war between a higher and lower grade of
civilization.... All the great interests of civilization are pledged
to the final triumph of the soldiers of this Republic," he said. The
oration was received with frequent bursts of applause. At its conclu-
sion, Colonel Sawyer of the 8th Ohio rose and thanked the orator.

ers. Letters from the governor of Ohio and Major General Heintzelman,

will rapidly increase, and then men who invest their funds are entirely
safe. (3)
1078 - L Nov. 21; ed: 2/2 - According to an official report, there are
27,000 people in New York living in low, damp, dark, and unventilated
cellars.
"In our own city there is poverty, but thank God, not many are com-
pelled to drag out a wearisome life in damp noxious cellars. But even
here, as elsewhere, inuch could be done for the poor by the erection of
suitable tenement houses." (3)
ILLITERACY
1079 - L Jan. 7; ed:2/1 - In a recent issue the New York NEWS says
that Ohio, the greatest abolition state, has more white citizens that can
neither read nor write their own name than the five southern states of
Arkansas, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Mississippi. As a matter
of fact, in Ohio's population of 1,955,050 whites, the number unable to
read or write is 61,030. The combined population of the five states men-
tioned is 933,707 whites, and 60,292 of them can neither read nor write.
"These facts establish a positive mis-statement of the case. An-
other fact is this: In the state of Ohio, the party which affects to be
Democratic, received four-fifths of all the votes cast by men unabie to
read or write.... When the Woods organ attempts another plea for barbarism
in the South, and defeat at home, let it be a little more honest and can-
did in its statements." (12)
IMMIGRATION &amp; EMIGRATION
1080 - L. Mar. 17; ed:2/1 - Notwithstanding the condition of "immigrants"
when they land here and notwithstanding the horror of a three-year civil
war, 200,000 immigrants have landed on our shores.
"When peace comes again, a half million will annually find a welcome
home on the soil of the Republic." (18)
1081 - L Apr. 4; ed:2/1 - Thousands of skilled laborers in Europe want to
come to the United States. There are great demands for workmen in the
North.
"What congressman will urge the adoption of some plan to facilitate
immigration to this country." (2)
1082 - L Apr. 26; ed:2/1 - The scarcity of labor has created a necessity
for skilled artisans. Mr. Seward proposes an increase in the number of
vessels for conveying immigrants, with the adoption of a system enabling
immigrants to make the passage by use of credit, under obligation to repay
costs out of early avails of their labor, after arriving.

IMMIGRATION &amp; EMIGRATION (Cont'd)
"Not only now but after the War, the broad acres of the West and
South will invite hundreds of thousands of skilled artisans of Europe.
Let Congress act wisely and immediately." (13)
1083 - L. July 1; ed: 2/2 - Due to the large number of immigrants, a bureau
of immigration has been established. The Union party has pledged to en-
courage immigration. If immigrants are told of the advantages of our coun-
try, the increase in population next year will be greater than the losses
due to the war. (2)
1084 - L July 11; ed: 2/2 - It is encouraging to see the enthusiasm which
is bringing so many immigrants to our country. Not even war can discourage
the people of Europe from coming to America to establish homes, and "we
have reason to think that even though there is a frightful war, America
is the most desirable home cn earth." - (6)
1085 - L July 12; ed: 4/4 - Reports that 10,000 Swiss immigrants await
passage to the United States "furnishes a remarkable instance of the grow-
ing appreciation with which this country is regarded in Switzerland, and
the desire of her people to come hither." - - - (2)
1086 - L. July 13; ed: 3/2 - The object of the American Emigrant co. is to
find workmen in foreign countries and order and assist immigrants who
come to this country to find good places without delay. "The managers
of this company are men of highest capacity and repute, and will bring
to it confidence and success." (2)
1087 - L Aug. 22; ed: 3/2 - The large and increasing emigration from Great
Britain and Ireland to the United States, and the enlistment of many im-
migrants in the Union army is causing much comment and discussion in the
British parliament.
In a speech Lord Howard says that the U. S. government has recruit-
ing agents on emigrant ships; also, that Englishmen, permitted to get
drunk on arrival in this country, have entered the Union forces to their
regret. "Such outrages are not confined to foreigners, however, and we
wish that means could be taken to stop them. We have failed to discover
any case that any state or federal officer had knowingly forced an emigrant
against his will into service, and as long as good land and high wages are
more easily obtained in this country than in England, there will not be
wanting Englishmen, Irishmen and other Europeans ready to avail themselves
of the offered advantages." (13)

1094 - L. Aug. 20; ed: 1/2, 3 - Fire insurance has become a matter of course,
causing its importance to be underestimated. Its systems, plans, and
principles deserve attention from both capital and labor - "all who are
worth anything."
The "participation" plan was introduced ten years ago and ten
stock fire companies have embraced it. At the close of 1863 these com-
panies had made over one million dollars in dividends. The Continental
co. was the first to adopt this plan and its example has influenced others.
"Manifestly, there is a great future for this system, and the Continental,
as one of its ablest, most conscientious and successful exponents will claim
and secure a foremost position." (23)

lated from hot to cold. (5)
1153 - L. Jan. 22:4/4 - Professor Agassiz told in his lecture of immense
glaciers having covered the larger portion of the northern hemisphere.
He explained how glaciers were made and gave a complete history of the

Professor Guiet, a foreigner too, on the platform of American citizen-
ship. - - (9)

Men's Christian Association, at the Euclid st. Presbyterian church.

in Gough's peculiar style. A large crowd attended. . (2)
1156 - L. Feb. 9:4/2 - John B. Gough will lecture at the Euclid st. Pres-
byterian church, on "Eloquence and Orators." The author's long experience,
keen analysis and rare power of oratory, enable him to handle this sub-
ject perfectly. - - (2)
1157 - L. Feb. 10; ed:4/3 - The lecture of John B. Gough was attended
by a large audience. There is no such thing possible as reporting
Gough's lecture. "Words convey nothing of the infinite play of fancy
and oratoric passion with which for two brief hours, he held spellbound
the varied souls before him." (10)
1158 - L. Feb. 19:3/2 - Professor Richard's lecture on "Tom Hood," last
night, was slimly attended due to the extremely cold weather. He has
penetrated far into the inner life of the humorist, and is in strong
sympathy with Hood's writings. - - (4)

1162 - L Nov. 29; ed:2/1 - "It is flattering to our National vanity
and consoling in the midst of our many afflictions, to know that "Arts
of Peace' flourish as well as the arts of war. Such a thing as literary
lectures is no doubt unknown in the South, but in the North, industrial
and literary pursuits go on the same as ever. Of the horrors of war,
we scarcely know anything.
"We see no reason why lyseums and lectures cannot be introduced into
every town and village in the State. Another source of literary recrea-
tion is the newspaper. It is a shame for intelligent people to plead
poverty as excuse for not obtaining daily or weekly papers. A little
energy, a little public spirit, and the Arts of peace may flourish in your
midst, and minds and hearts be relieved of the terrible pressure which
brooding over this unhappy war is calculated to produce." (17)
1163 - L. Dec. 2:4/3 - Brainard's hall was filled last night to hear Dr.
J. G. Holland's lecture on "Cost and Compensation." He did not presume to
Present any new and searching views, but tried to enforce old truths and . . .
self evident doctrines. Anong the qualities we must exchange for the se-
curing of the highest good, be enumerated time, sensual pleasure, vitality,
ease and will, with all the pride of life. -

1165 - L. Dec. 24: 1/3 - Those who attended the lecture last night of
Fitz Hugh Ludlow, were keenly disappointed. His subject, "Good Living,"
is one which should be treated with a "biending of gravity and humor."
The lecture was a mass of incoherencies, put together without any con-
structive idea or purpose to give them unity... it was altogether unworthy
of the reputation and spirit of the man, and vastly unworthy of the sub-
ject. Ludlow, knowing he had made a failure, pleaded with the editor
to make no mention of it in the LEADER. He said he had been critically
ill only a week before and had made no preparation. "This is no excuse
however, because a man has no right to lecture on 'Good Living' when
he has nothing to offer but a mass of indigestibles." (7)

MARKETS &amp; MARKETING
Produce Markets
Note. The following abstracts are a sample of the narrative market
reports only. They were taken on the first and fifteenth of each month,
when available, or as close as possible to those dates.
1176 - L. Jan. 1:4/6 - Markets are quiet and steady on all commodities
in Cleveland. New York and Chicago markets report about the same. (12)
1177 - L. Jan. 21:4/7 - The market has not yet recovered from the stag-
nation caused by the storm. There are no receipts, no purchasers, and
of course no transactions to report. (1)
1178 - L. Mar. 21:4/6 - I,ittle can be said of today's market, except that
the dullness of the week continues. The receipts of grain are in excess
of the demand and the prospect of full storehouses, unless an improve-
ment is reached, is most flattering. There was scarcely any inquiry
for corn, and the prices are nominal. Highwines are inactive with but
little inquiry. Prime butter is in demand and sells readily. Seeds
are dull; timothy is somewhat unsettled. The demand for flour is chief-
ly for home trade. (2)
1179 - L. Mar. 22:4/6 - The prevailing decline of last week was realized
in the market today. Business, so far as sales are concerned, is vir-
tually at a standstill. Three light movements of grain occurred during
the day, with scarcely anything worthy of note in the provision line.
The quotations of Mar. 19 were maintained. Grain receipts continue
largely in excess of the demand. (2)
1180 - L. Apr. 1:4/5 - The market today was very quiet; the show in corn
and wheat almost entirely subsided. The cause for this is found in the
unsettled condition of gold and the eastern markets, operating upon the
action of buyers and sellers. Holders, however, are generally firm,
and prices well maintained. (1)
1181 - L. Apr. 15:4/6 - The market today did not show so much excitement,
but the speculative demand was still strong and active, especially for
wheat. (3)

MARKETS &amp; MARKETING - Produce Markets (Cont'd)
1182 - L. May 2:4/6 - The receipts for wheat and corn for the week have
been somewhat in excess of those of the previous week. -
The wheat market has been extremely dull, heavy, and unsettled, and
though no material change has been made in prices from last week, the
tendency is toward a decline. Shippers have been holding back for a
lower market. -
Flour has been quiet during the week, the demand coming from home
trade. The sales reported do not show any changes from last week, but
the present prices of wheat hardly justify lower flour prices. Until
there is a radical decline in wheat, flour prices shall not be quoted
below present figures.
Corn has been only in moderate request, and the closing figures of
last week have been maintained.
Oats have received only a moderate inquiry, but were ruled firm from
store, a decline of l; being noted on Apr. 9. Rye and barley have
been without movement.
Provisions have been active and bouyant throughout the week, and
most articles have advanced. The market is firm.
Butter and eggs are generally quiet and prices have declined 3g on
the butter and l; on the eggs. There is a fair supply of new butter
coming in. -
Highwines have been dull all week. On Apr. 29, a panic seized the
market, in consequence of the passage by the House of Representatives
of Washburne's resolution, which calls for taxing stock on hand. Prices
dropped from $1.15 to $1.05 Q $1.07; the market closed very weak.
The grocery market is excited, as all articles have advanced, and
stocks are not large. The holders are very firm. -
Lake fish have advanced and are in good demand and firm at present
quotations. -
Most kinds of lumber have advanced, and the demand is active, with
free arrivals. Salt advanced 20g per barrel.
Petroleum, influenced by congressional action, advanced and the price
was maintained throughout the week. (10)
1183 - L. May 16:4/6 - The past week has been the dullest ever to be
remembered. For the past ten days, everyone's attention has been drawn
to the military operations in Virginia. -
This market during the week has been dull and inactive, scarcely
enough doing from day to day to establish prices. Most of the time we
have been compelled to give only nominal quotations. (6)
1184 - L. May 27:4/2 - Strawberries come to our Cleveland markets just
once a year. They are here now at 50g per quart. (1)
1185 - L June 1:4/7 - The general market continues very quiet, though a
slight improvement is noticed in the inquiry for some articles. (1).

MARKETS &amp; MARKETING - Produce Markets (Cont'd)
1186 - L June 17:4/6 - Now that the speculative mania is held in sub-
ordination by threatened legislation, speculation has sought a new
field, and the great staples, wheat, and pork have become the objects
of its present attention. It is not shown that there is an increased
demand for these commodities, either on home or foreign account, but
on the contrary a diminution in the regular channel. (3)
1187 - L. July 1:4/6 - The quiet that succeeded yesterday's excitement
in the leading markets brought matters here to a pause and disposed
operators to await further developments before entering into the specu-
lative field. There was still considerable feeling in flour ard wheat,
and were it not for the extreme stringency of the currency market, oper-
ations would doubtless be upon a much enlarged scale.
The demand for fish is active, induced by the high prices of meats,
and dealers report a further advance on whitefish due to its scarcity. , (4)
1188 - L July 3:4/6 - The flour markct is firm. After reports from
New York, the market advanced.
Corn market is firm, holders refusing bids; provisions firm; pork entirely
neglected; highwines dull, same price quoted; butter a shade firmer; eggs
steady; cheese firm and in fair demand; petroleum quiet and firm. (11)
1189 - H July 5:3/8 - The produce market is very quiet. Holders general-
ly are asking the closing rates of July 3 for all kinds of produce.
Flour is selling at $10.50, butter at 32g, and eggs at 22g. (8)
1190 - L. July 15:4/5 - The receipts of grain today by rail and canal
are larger than for any day in several months.
The markets all day have been stagnant. There has been no demand
at all for wheat or flour, and there have not been enough transactions
to establish quotations. (2)
1191 - L. Aug. 1:4/6 - There was nothing done on the exchange with the
exception of the sale of red wheat on the track at $2.08. The market
closed dull and heavy, after one of the most inactive and spiritless
weeks ever known at this season of the year, when, generally, everything
is moving freely. The new wheat crop will probably start moving in the
course of a few weeks, and the old stock will have to be gotten out of
the way at some price to make room for it. Flour has been a drug on the
market for the past two weeks, with the stock large and daily increasing.
There is no material change in provisions or other leading articles, ex-
cept a $2 incline on pork; and all have been ruled dull or inactive, ex-
cept for one or two articles of smoked meats. (5)
1192 - L. Aug. 15:4/6 - In the grain market there is the same dullness
and inactivity as has prevailed for the past ten days.
After the New York report was read at the board of trade, there was
a firmer feeling in wheat and a better demand for city and interior
millers, but nothing to show a decided improvement in price or demand,

as there was no shipping demand. Inquiries were confined to the choic-
est samples on the track and the prices obtained would hardly be a
fair criterion of the state of the market.
1193 - L. Sept. 1:4/3 - The city council met last night and adopted the
following resolution: That the city marshal be instructed to remove
all melon wagons on the south side of the Square.
1194 - L. Sept. 1:4/6 - It should be understood that all sales of grain
made on this market are from store. This is according to the new
regulations of the board of trade.
The receipts were small, and the market this morning was dull and
inactive. The news from New York, showing an advance in gold and pro
duce, had only the effect to make the market a little firmer. -
Salt has arrived more freely within the past few days and there is
now a liberal stock on the market. - -
1195 - L. Sept. 15:4/7 - There was no improvement in the receipts of
grain by rail and canal today, hardly enough coming forward to supply
the daily wants. The upward trend of gold yesterday afternoon hardened
the market here, and there was considerable more firmness in produce.
The stock of flour being light and the demand fair, prices have been
well sustained, and no material change has taken place for a week.
There is not much doing in provisions; the market remains as pre-
viously reported. Eggs are scarce and under a good demand, and are ad-
vancing. . . . . . . . ."
Petroleum and highwines keep quiet and steady with only a light home
demand at nominal rates. - - -
1196 - L. Oct. 10:4/7 - The past week has been one of great depression
in the markets for all kinds of grain and produce, and the transactions
have been very limited, as buyers have no confidence in the stability of
the market from day to day.
1197 - L. Oct. 15:4/6 - The steady and large advance of gold has caused
more firmness in produce in this market, and an advance is noticed on
nearly all the prices. There was more disposition to buy, but buyers
and sellers being apart in their views, few transactions were reported.
1198 - L. Nov. 1:4/8 - The market today was not very active, but the
sales show an aivance of 22, and 3g on wheat over the closing rates of
Oct. 29. Flour is in moderate request and the market is firm. Corn is
firm and in light receipt, but the demand is not heavy. Oats are dull
and nominally unchanged.

1199 - L Nov. 15:4/7 - Grain receipts by rail and canal continue light.
Flour is firm and steady with fair demand. There was a considerable
feeling in the grain market, with an increased firmness especially for
corn, but the transactions were limited and wheat sales were the same
as of Nov. 11. The margin in the price of grain between this port and
Buffalo is fair for ordinary times, but rates on freight, insurance, and
other expenses have so advanced that little can be made, even at the
liberal margin now existing, and but little is being shipped. (4)
1200 - L. Dec. 1:4/7 - The receipts of grain by rail today equal about
as much as for any day during the past year. The market on the river
this morning was dull and quiet. At the board this afternoon, grain
took a downward turn, and a decline of 22 took place in wheat. Corn
was dull and nominally lower. (1)
1201 - L. Dec. 15:4/5 - The receipts of grain continue small. There is
much inquiry for wheat for city and country trade, but the great lack
of cars prevents shipments by rail to any extent, and the transactions
are limited. With a light stock on hand and small receipts, prices
are well maintained. (3)

so he turned a young lady to stone. (4)

MONEY (Cont'd)
An important feature in it is that importers will not be restricted,
in the purchase of the certificates, to their daily and weekly wants; but
if apprehensive to future rise in gold, they can provide themselves with
a sufficient sum for months ahead to pay their duties.
Another influence in the decline of gold is the dividend in gold of
$3,000,000 on the seven 20 per cents to be paid out of the treasury to-
In Orr OW. (5)
1251 - L Apr. 1:4/5 - By some means, the gold market in New York was
pushed to an advance of 2-3/4 per cent at closing, which made the market
firmer. The market here was weak; transactions were restricted by a fear
of change, favorable or unfavorable in the east.
Money has had an active demand, and the market was rulcd very close.
Bankers had difficulty supplying the calls made upon them. (3)
1252 - L Apr. 16:4/3 - H. B. Hurlburt, Esq., cashier of the Second Nation-
al bank of Cleveland, is displaying new twenties and fifties. Fifty
thousand dollars of these new bills will be issued by this bank. The
left hand vignette of the twenties bears a picture representing the spirit
of 1775. On the right is a picture emblematic of "loyalty." The left
hand vignette of the fifties represents Washington crossing the Delaware.
(6)
1253 - L Apr. 16:4/6 - The movement of gold is again downward, influenced
by a large degree to the interest payments started today upon the five-20
coupons maturing in May.
The market here was unsettled with very little offering. The chief
buying rate was 170. (2)
1254 - L. May 2:4/6 - There was only a nominal decline in gold today. The
buying rate here was the same as vesterday, 76 per cent premium. (2)
1255 - L. May 16:4/6 - Regardless of the fact that our armies are victori-
ous in Virginia and Georgia, gold maintains its position, and closed high-
er today than yesterday. It is hard to account for this, except that the
decline in the ruling rates of the past week discounted a decisive victory.
A great help to the operators in keeping up the price is in the heavy
demand for shipment. The buying rate here today was pretty uniformly 67.
There has been an active demand for money, and the discounts amounted
to a large aggregate. (3)
1256 - L June 2:4/6 - Gold closed in New York today at an advance of 1-1/4
per cent over yesterday's closing rate. It is most surprising that in
the face of the most favorable condition of the military situation, the
gamblers are still able to maintain the present high premium on gold.
The buying rate here today was uniformly 85 premium. (3)
1257 - L. June 17:4/6 - The gold movement has been uncommonly quiet at the
present, the cause probably being the pending legislation for the punishment
of that speculation peculiar to gold and stock gambling.

MONEY (Cont'd)
The closing rate was 97-1/4. Dealers here bought uniformly at 95 and
sold at 98 premium.
The money market is working toward increased stringency under an active
and accumulating demand, and the banks have been compelled to pay out as
currency their five per cent notes. - (3)
1258 - L June 18; ed:2/4 - The new two-cent piece which has recently been
issued by the mint has the great fault of resembling the five dollar
gold piece.
"Sharpers will take advantage of this, and the ignorant may learn by
bitter experience that 'all that glitters is not gold.'" (3)
1259 - L June 20; ed: 2/1 - In many western states wild-cat currency has
already received its deathblow. The only currency that should circulate
is national currency. -
"Let Ohio do likewise. Take none but greenbacks, national bank notes,
and bills of our own state." (4)
1260 - L. July 1:4/6 - The buying rates in gold here today were 220 Q 225,
selling rates were nominal. -
Bankers generally reached the stopping point in the discount line to-
day and were compelled to refuse all paper offerings. There is no money
of consequence coming from the east. (4)
1261 - L Dec. 28:4/7 - The demand for currency in this market for the
past ten days, particularly upon the national banks, has been larger
than was probably ever before experienced, and as a consequence, a -
tight market is experienced. (3)
Inflation
1262 - L. Mar. 1; ed:2/2 - Gold was worth 172 in the New York market,
Feb. 24. Now it has fallen to 158-1/2 where it stays. "Keep harping on
the inflation of the currency, and the resources of the Rebels, and you'
may fetch it up." (3)
1263 - L. Mar. 15; ed: 2/1,2 - "We appeal to the Union Congressmen to
take hold of this matter and compel the decline of gold.
"Do this and it is equal to half a dozen great union victories. If
the present Congress yields to lobbymen on a matter so important as this,
they will only assist the rebellion, protract the war and condemn them-
selves to political graves from which they will never rise." (5)
1264 - L Apr. 21; ed:2/1 - One year ago, gold stood at $1.75, and now
it stands at $1.25. The political condition of the country and the
strength of the army is much better now than at that time. --

floating currency, thereby reducing the inflation at least 400 millions;
a bill strengthening our armies; a bi il giving Grant command of the un-
limited resources of the country: - these bills, constituting the deci-
sive legislation for which the country now suffers, are all that is
needed to re-strengthen public confidence and set gold to tumbling down
to greenbacks at a rate alarming to all the bloodsuckers that are feeding
on the life blood of the nation." (12)
1265 - L June 19; ed:2/1 - The evil effects of an over-issue of paper
money are apparent in the frightful inflation of prices prevalent every-
where. Mr. Chase has recently said that with an effective tax bill and
the utter extirpation of all the state rag-mill bills, he could in a short
time return to a specie basis.
"We believe this might be done, and feel assured that the people will
respond to the appeals of Mr. Chase for luoney on his present plan, in of-
fering these loans to the highest bidder." (4)
1266 - L June 24; ed: 2/1 - The gold bill does not allow gold to be sold
at a public board, in the usual manner. There is no sufficient register
immediately furnished to determine the true value of gold. Some brokers
ask $200, or $240 for gold. "People need not be alarmed at all, as
Secretary Chase is already on the track of these gamblers." (3)
1267 - L June 28; ed: 2/1 - The value of gold and its relation to the
currency of accounting, are questions which have absorbed attention for a
great many years.
In spite of the late gold bill, it continues to be quoted at a very
advanced rate. It seems evident that the gold bill produced a consider-
able flutter among the whole tribe of Jews, goid conspirators, and stock
brokers.
"A strong effort to keep gold up to its presert position will there-
fore be made to intimidate Congress. We believe, however, that when
once they discover their efforts to be fruitless, gold will seek its
proper level." (9)
1268 - L. July 20; ed: 2/1 - The declaration concerning the money market
in New York city generally presages renewed interest in speculation.
Speculators will renew their efforts to raise prices on articles of wear,
and consumption, if there is another issue of currency.
"It is to be hoped the money market may be kept 'tight' long enough
to ruin the gamblers who are pushing gold 100 percent above its proper
level." (3)
1269 - L. Oct. 5; ed: 2/4 - Now that gold is on the down grade, certain
supporters of the Chicago ticket are organizing a grand combination against
its face.
"They will have a hard pull however, if they enter the arena against Grant
and Sheridan, who knock Gold down as with the thunder hammer of Thor."

1270 - L Oct. 15; ed: 2/1 - "Those who reflect but little may ascribe the
advance in gold to the prospective re-election of Abraham Lincoln. On
Tuesday it was quoted at 201 and yesterday at 213. The advance of twelve
percent is explained on very different grounds however, if the rise and
fall of gold is to be regarded as controlled by the usual influences at
work.... Many foreign capitalists are speculating in our trade. The
higher gold is, the cheaper they can make their purchases. They could af-
ford to run gold much higher than it now is, for the sake of making cheaper
purchases.... Of course all inter sted in the purchase of bonds for for-
eign buyers are anxious to get gold up as high as possible. This of it-
self will explain the advance. Another fact to be remembered is that we
are on the very eve of a financial panic.... Still another cause is
found in the fact that such men as Belmont... feel that their last hope
lies in an attempt to scare the people into the idea that the re-election
of Abraham Lincoln puts off the day of Peace, and will result in the
advance in price of all things.... These three influences are enough in
themselves to explain any rise in gold that may take place for the next
three weeks. - - -
* ..."There is nothing in the military situation to justify it. The pros-
pects grow brighter every day. Every intelligent man who also knows that
no greater blow can befall the rebellion than the re-election of Abraham
Lincoln." - (10)
1271 - L Oct. 17; ed:2/3 - The rise and fall of gold is almost entirely
governed by trickeries of gambling, instead of the laws of trade. A
visit to the New York stock exchange should be convincing enough that the
present value of gold is fictitious. "Gold gambling is a crime against
the interests of society at large, and it is absurd to suppose that a lot
of gamblers, sweating, swearing, foaming at the mouth, gnashing their
teeth, swayed by domestic fears, can properly regulate the relative value
of gold and greenbacks. The country will see it before long, when a terrible
collapse must ensue." - - (7)

"The NEW NATION is quite orphic in its style. Possibly it intends
to have the public understand that the PATHF INDER is to have a grand
ovation of Congressional applause which is to come forth as an unpre-
cedented outburst! By hanging around the ante-rooms of politicians
and eavesdropping the sagacious gentlemen whom the people send to Wash-
ington as their servants, this sensational writer has discovered that
the strength of Mr. Lincoln in the country at large, is a wind bag that
needs only to be punched to collapse. After this revelation we shall
be looking for the inauguration of a punching campaign.
"In the meantime let the nation watch with all commendable diligence
until this atmospheric phenomenon shall duly take place. We should like
to see politicians properly stimulated, even unto legislative wisdom.
But we would rather forego the startling military disaster than to have
an unprecedented outbursst from Washington. The latter can be survived;
the former may prove disastrous." (11)

every kind of snaky attitude to throw discredit upon the government
and the North.
"In Tuesday's (April 26) edition of that delectable sheet, we have
a beautiful specimen of coppery logic. The philanthrophy of abolition-
ists is the subject of a bitter tirade. The organ of Jeff regards it
as not a very genuine article. Why so? Because abolitionists forget
the ignorance, depravity, destitution, and death at their own doors in
their sympathy with the slaves. Now, we can assure you, Mr. Times,
their sympathies are largely directed toward the ignorance, depravity,
and destitution which prevails in the ranks of the copperheads." (4)
1357 - L. May 11; ed:2/2 - The New York HERALD wants Lieutenant General
Grant for president and John C. Fremont for vice president. "The moral
character of the great Trimmer Fremont, is too well understood to be of
any great service to any cause." (3)
1358 - L. May 21; ed:2/1 - The manner in which the forged proclamation
found its way into the New York papers shows that the whole affair
was a miserable "Copperhead" scheme to make money. The object was to
stimulate the Confederate stocks in England and to advance gold here.
"We do not think, from all the circumstances in the case, that the
journals suppressed, knowingly published it as a forgery." (4)

closed the WORLD and the JOURNAL OF COMMERCE for three days, for pub-
lishing semi-rebellious sentiments.
** "We hope the WORLD will learn from this that the nation is as yet
by no means ready to rush into revolt, at its revolutionary bidding."
1364 - L. May 25; ed: 2/1,2 - The New York WORLD, after an interregnum of
three days, makes its appearance. Its chief editor, Manton Marble, ad-
dresses an editorial three and one-half columns long to Abraham Lincoln.
The letter opens with a flourish of knowledge on the constitutional
points in the case. Then follows a recitation of the circumstances
leading to the publication of the hoax. - - -
"It was only the great liberty the Press enjoys, that allows the re-
publication of the WORLD." - - (10)

1365 - L. May 26; ed: 2/1 - J. P. Reig sold his interest in the Conneaut
REPORTER to S. Kelsey.
"Messrs. Reig and Kelsey have made the paper a very valuable country
paper and Reig's retirement will be a loss to the people of Ashtabula
county." (1)

Daniel S. Dickin are chosen delegates at large, in New York.
"What better men could have been selected?" (1)
1368 - L June 4; ed: 2/1 - Horace Greeley's absence from the "Fremont"
convention was a surprise. "While Greeley expressed a preference for
Fremont some weeks ago, he has emphatically stated that the TRIBUNE
would support the nominee of the Baltimore Unicrl Convention, whoever
he might be." (1)
1369 - L June 4; ed:2/2 - Mr. Craig of the Associated Press did not
dream that the proclamation would appear after he had denied its author-
ity, so he left no instructions for the day reporter not to send it.
The day reporter sent it over the wires.
"The Western Press, the I.EADER among the number, has unintentially
done Mr. Craig great injustice in charging him with purposely sending
the proclamation when he knew it was false." (5)
1370 - L June 8; ed: 2/1 - The Democratic journals attribute the result
of Grant's campaign to McClellan's "generalship." They also declare
that Lee has Grant just where he wants him. "It is possible that they
do not see the connection." (l)
1371 - L June 10; ed:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER implied that the Baltimore
convention was a very weak affair and deficient in numbers. "Since
its supremely false article on the Clevelan convention, nobody will
believe anything that it may have to say, at least in regard to con-
ventions." (2)
1372 - L June 14; adv: 1/1 - Job printing of every description. Done in
the best style. Legal blanks for sale at the LEADER counting-room.

1374 - L June 19; ed:2/1 - It has been four days since the return of
Wallandigham, yet the PLAIN DEALER has not a word to say. -
"It is evidently yet repenting in sackcloth and ashes for its great
defection last fall." - (2) .
1375 - L June 21; ed:4/5 - Republicans and Rebels are the cause of the
war, according to the new mode of attack employed by certain Democratic
journals. The Republicans elected a president, as they had a right to
do; the Rebels didn't like this; consequently they revolted. "We had
supposed that such silly attempts at logic liad died out, but the WORLD
is industriously at work just now in renewing them." (2)
L June 25:2/1 - See Wars - Civil War (Officers)
1376 - L July 1; ed:2/2 - The New York DAILY NEWS has been doubtful for
some time of the success of the Democracy, but sees an opportunity for
success in the Fremont movement. (1)
1377 - L. July 4: 1/8 - "The few remaining barriers between the people
and despotism are being fast swept away. It is up to the people to
bar further lawlessness." - -
The above from the Chicago TIMES shows the style in which "Copperheads"
are always complaining and whining about despotism, and their cry
heard all over the land is, "We are so oppressed, ain't we." (3)
1378 - L. July 4:4/2 - Starting tomorrow, we will change the type used
in printing, or will get a "new dress," as editors effectionately say. (6)
1379 - L. July 6:4/2 - This is the first issue of the LEADER in "new -
dress." It speaks for itself. - (1)
1380 - L July 11:4/2 - We offer a $25 reward for the identity of the
person who entered the news room and pied a case of type. (1)
1381 - L. July 11:4/3 - E. Cowles, publisher of the LEADER, was assaulted
by Amos Coe, a "Copperhead," on July 9. It seems the cause of the
difficulty was an article printed in the LEADER concerning Mr. Coe's re-
fusal to enter the service on being drafted. - (6)
1382 - L July 14; ed: 3/2 - A recent article in the New York DAILY NEWS
eulogizes pirate Semmes. "The News is not only destitute of character
but destitute of the instinct of a national pride." (1)
1383 - L. July 15; ed:2/1 - We apologize to contributors whose articles
do not appear in the paper. It is not always lack of merit but lack

1384 - L July 18; ed: 1/3 - The New York DAILY NEWS makes an appeal to the
governor of New York to take up arms against the administration, charging
Lincoln with violating the "freedom of the press."
"We should suppose that in a land where such sentinents are permitted
to be scattered without rebuke, the freedom of the press might be con- -
sidered sufficiently maintained for all practical purposes." (3)
1385 - L. July 27:4/2 - George Hoyt of the PLAIN DEALER staff, lately a
private in the 150th, O. N.G., has resigned. - (2)
1386 - L Aug. 4:2/1 - Today being "Fast Day," no paper will be issued
from this office for tomorrow. All important news received wiil be
displayed on the LEADER bulletin board or issued in extras. (2)
1387 - L Aug. 22; ed: 2/3 - The PLAIN DEALER complains of being "dizzy"
in watching the "political acrobats" of the Union press and party.
"We look upon the dizziness which we have already produced as an
evidence that a revolution is going on somewhere in the vicinity of
the Democratic rooster that has waited a long time for an opportunity
to crow. Allow us to congratulate the PLAIN DEALER, upon the effect of
the sound doctrines which are set forth in the LEADER." - (4)
1388 - L. Aug. 29:3/2 - George Hoyt, formerly city editor of the PLAIN
DEALER, leaves Cleveland and goes to Cincinnati for a position with
the TIMES. (2)
1389 - L. Sept. 5; ed: 2/1 - Owing to the scarcity of cotton rags, white
printing paper has advanced 170 percent. Labor, ink, coal, telegraph
bill, and most everything else which goes to produce a newspaper has
advanced, thus compelling us to raise the price of the LEADER. "We
pledge ourselves that when the cost of printing materials goes down
our subscription price shall go down in the same ratio." (7)
1390 - L. Sept. 6; ed:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER pronounces as liars and
slanderers, all who say that the Democratic party would for the sake
of peace "compromise the integrity of the nation, honor of the flag or
the self respect of the people." -
LEADER:
"Tell us what dishonor is, if it is honor to ask for an armistice,
when the rebels themselves scout the idea of anything but a separation."
(4)
1391 - L. Sept. 12; ed:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER makes the assertion that
Lincoln declared in 1848 that the right of revolution is a sacred thing.
"Lincoln did not justify a rebellion, however, which was consummated
against the vill of the people, and which has not freedom for its object,
but the strengthening of despotism and slavery." - -
The PLAIN DEALER'S knowledge of history must be limited if it does
not know that the rebellion of Jeff Davis is not a rebellion of the
people, and that the whole work of secession was managed by a secret body
of traitors at Washington. (8)

1392 - L. Sept. 17:2/4 - In a letter to the editor, E. Cluseret says
that three individuals without means, proposed to publish his newspaper,
NEW NATION, under certain conditions. They did not fulfill them and
created debts ruining the newspaper. Then they declared that the news-
paper belonged to them. Was this rational? "I am a very unimportant
personage in comparison with Mr. Fremont, who has boasted to me that he
could stop the course of justice for five years in New York in his own
favor; but I doubt if he can stop that of public opinion." (5)
L Sept. 23; ed: 2/2 - See Slavery
1393 - L Sept. 29; ed:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER declares that it will
conduct a campaign to suit itself. "We have no doubt of it. Notwith-
standing the contempt into which it has fallen among decent and sen-
sible Democrats, it will stick to its element. The defense that might
be made for its candidate and platform will not be safe, simply be-
cause it is bound to stick to ribaldry." (2)
1394 - L Oct. 8; ed: 2/2 - The mendacity of the PLAIN DEALER is well
illustrated in its comments on the demonstration at the Union rally.
It talks about General Garfield being introduced and "demonstrating"
that the rebellion had been cut in twain etc. Garfield was not in
Cleveland that day, but in Delaware.
LEADER: -
"This shows how the PLAIN DEALER makes lies out of the 'whole cloth. '"
(2)
1395 - L. Oct. 8; ed:4/4 - The PLAIN DEALER writhes and squirms through
a dozen paragraphs in the issue of Oct. 8, and tries to shift blame of
the outrages committed by "Copperheads" at the Union rally. "It is
no use. All its subterfuges will not hide the fact that these out-
rages were committed by Copperhead rowdies. So squirm away, Mr. Plain
Dealer, your agitation shows that at least you are not lost to all sense
of shame." (2)
1396 - L. Oct. 12:4/2 - W. A. Collins, Esq., political editor of the
PLAIN DEALER, has resigned and intends to practice law in this city.
(1)
1397 - L Oct. 14:2/2 - The PLAIN DEALER tells of the retirement of
John J. Jacobs, manager of the Ashland UNION, and "wishes success to
J. W. McCord, B. F. Nelson and J. M. Landis, successors to Jacobs. The . .
UNION has had the reputation of being the most outspoken advocate of
treason and the most violent, abusive and obscene in political discus-
sions, among papers of southern Ohio.
"We had hoped that a change of administration might result in im-
provement in these respects. Our expectations were not met however
judging from quotations from the first issue published under the auspices
of these gentlemen of 'sound Democratic principles' as the PLAIN DEALER
sees fit to call them. Lying, misquoting, abuse of soldiers, blasphemy,
and obscenity, then, are the 'sound Democratic Principles' of the Plain
Dealer." (17)

1398 - L Nov. 7; ed:4/2 - "The PLAIN DEALER is nimble as a kangaroo
at lying; it can vault over truth, piled ever so high, with perfect
ease. "Adept in the art of not telling the truth, it either has genius
for lying or has served a long apprenticeship." (3)
1399 - L Nov. 7; ed:4/2 - The PLAIN DEALER is pleased because Mrs.
Walling, a Texas refugee, did not speak at the Union meeting. Why
gloat over her failure to speak? An ass once tried to pass as a lion
and donned a Lion's skin as a disguise; but somehow the ears worked out
to view. "The PLAIN DEALER goes in big for the Union but is afraid to
hear a Union refugee tell of her escape and experience."
Beware of the long ear, 0 neighbor." (2)
1400 - L Nov. 11; ed: 2/1 - The PLAIN DEALER says that "Lincoln will
shape his policy to meet the sentiment of the Northern people."
"We are glad to see the PLAIN DEALER appreciate that fact so soon."
(3)
1401 - L Nov. 19; ed: 2/2 - "The PLAIN DEALER has grown so melancholy
since the election that it lashes the President because he will tell
anecdotes. The PLAIN DEALER doesn't like his jokes and calls them
tricks. Poor PLAIN DEALER! It is rapidly falling into the sloughs of
a most wretched moroseness." (2)
1402 - L Nov. 22; ed:4/5 - "After a sickly existence of three or four
months, the Cleveland EVENING DISPATCH died a natural death. Its de-
mise was doubtless hastened by its ill-advised adhesion to the Copper-
head party. It demonstrates that a fourth daily cannot be successfully
maintained in this city. The three papers already in circulation occupy
the whole ground, and no other paper can tirive here." (2)
1403 - L Nov. 24; ed: 2/1 - No paper wili be issued from this office
tomorrow morning, and our usual evening edition will not be printed
this afternoon. "Editors and printers, as well as other people, must
have leisure to discuss their Thanksgiving turkey." (2)
1404 - H Nov. 25; ed:4/2 - The Louisville JOURNAL has admitted that
slavery is doomed.
"The slow but sure old NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER also moderately and
carefully expresses its belief that general emancipation will be a
good thing. So we advance, step by step." (3)
1405 - L Nov. 30; ed: 2/2 - The Rebel editors make light of Grant and
Sherman. They make sport of Sherman's progress and "strut in their
self-confidence like peacocks in a barnyard. The present is a crisis
to the rebellion and it is necessary to put on airs, to bluster and
bel low, to grow jolly as the heavens grow darker, to dance and sing as
the funeral draws nigh. The rebel editors are certainly talented fel-
lows, they can laugh and grow fat in a grave yard." (4)

1406 - L Dec. 1; ed: 2/1 - The New York WORLD says that from now on it
intends to stand aloof from the government. It tells the Union party,
"You have your machine, now run it and don't potter about our duty.
Attend to your own. The Union is lost. Save it."
LEADER:
"We do not believe the WORLD is backed by the Democratic party
of which it claims to be the leading organ, in this shameless declara-
tion of treasonable neutrality and indifference. We look to see a
United North determined to see that the rebellion is put down. The
treason of the New York WORLD will not prevent that happy circumstance."
(4)
1407 - L Dec. 5; ed:2/2 - The New York HERALD speaks of the NEWS and
the WORLD as the "Incendiary Press" and accuses them of being instrumen-
tal in bringing about an attempt to burn New York city. This is rather
strong talk considering the HERALD'S Democratic tendencies." (2)
1408 - L Dec. 12; ed: 2/1 - Ever since MeClellan's defeat, the STATESMAN,
one of those newspapers that sees nothing but gloom, has been snapping
and snarling. It grow led at the LEADER because it expressed satisfac-
tion over the fact that President Lincoln was unwilling to negotiate
with Rebel leaders and restore them to power. "We have witnessed for
sometime... the tribulations among the STATESMAN editors." (4)
1409 - L Dec. 15; ed: 2/1 - After McClellan's defeat in the sword con-
test at the New York Sanitary fair, the New York HERALD, disgusted at
the result, started subscription for another sword for him. The total
amount contributed by a grateful nation was $712,000, but $227 was with-
drawn.
"Either the people are not very enthusiastic over the ex-general or
have a wholesome doubt of Bennett's honesty, and don't care to risk
money in his hands." (3)
1410 - L Dec. 20; ed:2/1 - "Efforts are being made to establish a
Democratic newspaper in Ashtabula county. The Chap who undertakes
that enterprise must have the sanguine temperament of the philosopher,
who thought he would extract blood out of a turnip." (l) .
1411 - L. Dec. 31; ed: 2/1 - "We bid the old year good-bye, then, and
take to our hearts for the new year just dawning, the strong confidence
that events inspire. The sturdy phild sophy of faith in the Republic,
will strengthen us for the new year. And as we stand on the confines
of 1864 and see 1865 at hand, we trust that our people may all rejoice
in treason overthrown, in the Union restored, in universal liberty to all
men, in the peace and prosperity which must follow war, and in the con-
scious approval of Heaven." - (15)

1413 - L Oct. 5; ed: 2/1 - "Nothing is more obvious than the support
given McClellan by the English Tory Press.... If there is a newspaper
in England whose prayer for years has been that the Union might be dis-
rupted, that one is the London HERALD, an ardent champion of McClellan....
"They approve an armistice and negotiations because they know that
under Democratic rule, in case of failure to restore the Union by nego-

of the South would be secured." (6)

1414 - L. Jan. 1:4/2 - The "carriers' Address" is presented to the public

ment in the LEADER, news room. Forty cents per 1,000 ems. (1)
1416 - L. July 11; ed: 2/1 - The Cleveland Typographical union demands
an advance in wages from 35 to 45 cents per 1,000 ems. The proprietors
of the LEADER and PLAIN DEALER agreed to pay 40 cents per thousand.
This strike will not interfere with the publication of the papers which
is assisted by volunteers. Prices for our paper would increase if demands
of the strikers are granted.
Wages are not as high in Cleveland as in New York, Chicago, and
Cincinnati, but living is also higher in those cities. Their circulation,
also, is much larger.
Under the rules of the union, no publisher can employ a non-union
foreman not even his own son, if he is not a union member. Any man re-
fusing to join is called "rat."
"From the tyranny of this unreasonable organization, we declare our-
selves free." (20)

1419 - L. Jan. 8; ed: 1/7 - Dr. James Young, 46 died yesterday of con-
sumption at his home, 36 Prospect st. Dr. Young's remarkable discover-
ies in electrical physiology within the past three years place his name
among the greatest philosophers who have harnessed this subtle element
to the ear of human progress, while the long array of discord and dis-
organized humanity will ever have cause to bless him for his perfection
of the electro thermal baths. He had a kind and good heart, and the
poor and friendless found a true and sympathizing friend in him. "It
may be truly said that 'the world is the better that he lived.'" (2)
1420 - L. Jan. 8; ed:4/2 - Joseph B. Bartlett, city auditor of Murison
and Superior sts. extension, died suddenly yesterday. He passed away
in the throes of an apoplectic fit. Between 65 and 70 years of age, he
was a resident of Cleveland about 30 years, coming here from Marblehead,
Mass. Soon after coming here, he was elected recorder of Cuyahoga coun-
ty and held that office several years before 1840.
For the past 13 years he had held the offices of city clerk and city
auditor and was in the latter position at the time of his death. His
faithfulness and accuracy endeared him to all political parties alike,
and no matter which party was in power, he was continued in his same
position.
"As an officer, citizen and gentleman he was a model and example and
death has removed one whom Cleveland can illy afford to lose." . . . (4)
1421 - L. Feb. 10:4/2 - Dr. Roswell Trask, 66, of Middleburgh, Cuyahoga

the war. Exposure, during duty, caused his death. (3)
1422 - L. Feb. 11:2/2 - The Rev. Caleb Pitkin of Summit county died at

lege and one of its trustees for 30 years. - (1)

ten years, died yesterday after a few days' illness. He was married

will be deeply felt by the business community. He lived in a palatial
residence on Euclid st. (4)
1424 - L. Sept. 27:4/4 - John Stair, 79, died Sept. 25 at his home, 168
Kinsman st., from a complication of diseases. Born in England, he came
to this country in 1832, He was a teacher by profession, and opened a
school which he carried on until 1835. With his son, Benjamin, he estab-
lished the well-known seed and agricultural implement store, where he
was engaged at the time of his death.
Mr. Stair was one of the founders of Westminster church and at his
death was a devout member of the First Presbyterian church.

1427 - L Nov. 26: ed: 2/1 - The announcement that James C. Medill is
dead will be sad news for his many friends in this city and throughout
the northwest who knew him as one of the ablest journalists of the time.
He was one of the founders of the Republican party, and was at one time
connected editorially with the LEADER, where he proved himself a pro-
found thinker and able writer, and champion of human rights. During . . . .
the period he was connected with the agricultural interests of the north- ‘
west he did much to elevate the standards of agriculture. He entered
politics in 1860 and did good service in the cause of freedom. He was
in constant pain for several years, being a sufferer from rheumatism.

1428 - L Dec. 9:4/3,4 - Leonard P. Case, Esq., was born July 20, 1784 in
Westmore land county, Pennsylvania. He moved to Ohio in 1800 and was a
resident of Cleveland for many years. He was striken with a violent
disease in 1810, which left him a cripple for the remainder of his life.
Knowing that he never would be able to do physical labor to support him-
self, he decided to do so by his pen. His education was limited so far
as book learning was concerned, there being no schools at that time. He
learned to write and cipher however, while he was confined to his bed.
In 1806 he went to Warren where he struggled for a time with poverty, *
but felt that here he would have better chance of success. His sterling
character and common sense brought him friends who helped him in his
writing and furnished him books until he was admitted to the bar. He be-
came collector of non-resident taxes during the war of 1812 and in
1816 was appointed cashier of the Commercial bank of Lake Erie. Although
a cripple and a constant sufferer, he survived all of the original direc-
tors and officers of this bank and by early and judicious investment
in real estate, he became one of the richest men in northern Ohio. Ile
leaves one son, two brothers and three sisters. (29)

1429 - L. Jan. 25:4/3 - There are 20 oil refineries in Clevela.md employing
over 100 men. They consume 4,000 barrels of crude oil per week at a
market price of $28,000. They produce weekly 3,000 barrels of refined
oil and benzol, which has a government tax of $4 per barrel, yielding a
revenue of $624,000 a year. Crude oil is run into tanks, then piped in-
to a still and distilled. From this benzol first appears, then distil-
lates oil. The distillates are run into an agitator, where they are mixed
and stirred with sulphuric acid till they becume sweet. Finally they
are washed with water and alkalies, and placed in "bleachers" ready for
the market. (16)
1430 - L. Feb. 2:4/2 - Alexander Wilson and Company's oil refinery is the
most enterprising in the city. They possess the largest stills and best
condensing pipes. Their oil is of the best quality, almost odorless and
colorless. The firm manufactures 40 barrels of oil per day, paying the
government $160 revenue on this amount. They employ 15 men. . (4)

retary. Charles Bratenahl, R. C. Yates, and S. Mann are directors. (2)

and makes present suffering endurable. (8)
1436 - L Nov. 29; ed:4/3 - Attention of speculators from all parts of the
country has been turned toward Cuyahoga county as affording excellent "in-
dications" for oil. The oil excitement has broken out in East Cleveland,
Rockport, and Independence. It is also reported that excellent indications
of oil have been found in the ravine cf Tinker's creek in Bedford township.
In Parma they have also been struck with the oil fever and have sunk a
well, but the unlucky diggers instead of striking oil struck rock. "We
seein pre-doomed to an immense oil excitement, and it behooves our citizens
to bear in mind the probability that it will not prove successful and to
resist all teudency to undue excitement." (19)

oil industry and though not far advanced as yet, promises to be active.
Several companies have been organized. (2)

reigns in Pennyslvania, especially in Meadville, Oil City, Franklin, and
Titusville. The disease "oil on the brain" is rapidly spreading. Some
have been lucky enough to realize handsomely on their investments. This
has been the means of stimulating tens of thousands into the belief that
they will be as fortunate. Petroleum interests in Pennsylvania are passing
through a period of speculation rather than a period of development. The
oil fever rages so high that many are tempted to buy lands without seeing
or really investigating them. Land laid out in water colored drawings,
with pumps and flowing wells carefully put down at appropriate distances,
are often very different from the land in reality, but eager speculators
have often invested their money in these water colored lands, which on exam-
ination, proved to be many miles from oil-producing territories. The oil
business is in its infancy and every day new discoveries are made as good
as the old. - (33)
1439 - L Dec. 19:2/3,4 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says that the
eagerness to make money, by buying and selling of oil lands at advanced
prices, is looked upon as being detrimental by men who actually have the in-
terests of the oil trade at heart. Men are anxious to speculate by buying
and selling lands, but do not want to develop them, because selling of lards
at advanced rates is a certain source of profit, attended by none of the
risks of actual development. The maps and sketches of the oil country now
drawn are inaccurate, but a large and detailed atlas of the oil regions
will be published in January, in New York.
The oil boom has been the means of starting a new branch of business in
drafting and sketching, which is followed by a number of lawyers at various
places. In regard to investing in oil stock there are various things to be

considered. It is true that many people have made from fifty to two thou-
sand per cent on their investments, but it is also true that just as many
have lost money. (31)
1440 - L. Dec. 20:2/2, 3 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says: The oil
business in Pennsylvania has become so extensive that petroleum furnishes
a medium of exchange with foreign countries which was lost in cotton, which
was kept off the market by the rebellion. Oil already competes with the
iron and coal industry of the state. Figures show that petroleum promises
to take precedence over the iron and coal industry within the next year. It
is estimated that four or five million barrels have been produced, though up
to this time there have been no statistics to show the actual amount. (25)
1441 - L Dec. 21:2/2, 3 - In a letter to the editor, J. H. R. says: The
character of the people in the oil regions is an unfailing subject of study.
The working population of these people is composed of yourg men. Although
much wealth has been accumulated in these regions, it is remarkable that so
few crimes have been committed. In fact, about the only scoundrels are the
legal ones.
It is much cheaper to procure oil than coal, iron, copper, lead, or gold.
Four men can put down a well in two months if they work night and day. No
department of industry offers such great rewards at so little expenditure
of labor. The boring for oil is mostly a matter of chance, and it is often
more unsuccessful than successful.
We have no confidence in the theory that oil is being manufactured spon-
taneously within the bowels of the earth. The facts prove the contrary.
The theory which regards oil as the distillate of marine plants at an age
prior to the coal formation would seem to imply that it is to be found as
wide-spread and inexhaustible as coal itself.
In certain districts, probably in the southeast border of the great sea,
where marine plants were carried by wind and water in immense quantities,
oil will be found in greater abundance than other places. This region will
be found in eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, southern Ohio, West Virginia,
Kentucky, and Tennessee. Here is a field of enterprise that stands open to
thousands whom the war has paralyzed. By keeping clear of all manner of
sharks, and pushing the work bravely on, many a man will yet realize an
immense fortune. (44)

extends all over the country and "grows bolder as the cause of the rebels
grows better." This organization, beyend a doubt, is to "defeat all

"He was a rough and cruel soldier, but brave and bold." (5)
1489 - L Dec. 22; ed: 2/1 - William Lewis Dayton, U. S. minister to
France, was one of the nation's ablest statesmen and one of its best
diplomatists. He was born in New Jersey 57 years ago, was admitted to
the bar in 1830, and was elected to the state council in 1837. In the
spring of 1861, he was appointed minister to France, and has since per-
formed the duties of that office with distinguished ability and success.
"News of his death... will cause a deep feeling of sorrow throughout the
country." (9)

1500 - L. Jan. 4:4/4 - The customary newspaper carriers' New Year's greeting
to patrons, which is usually composed in verse by one of the staff, and for
which the carriers receive tips, was as follows:
"To the long vista of the lengthening past
Old Time has added, now, another stride;
Another year, whose full-fraught days have raised
A glorious gnomon, which as ages glide
Down their smooth pathway, shall forever throw
Across the track by which the world moves on
A radiant glory, whose bright mark shall win,
From the pale student of the days to come
As pours he, over the story of our time;
Such words of praise of great and noble deeds
Done for a country or for human weal,
Bave ever won...." (12)

For his long and quiet rest."

"In the grave, in the grave -
The rain drips from the sky
Sinking through the dark brown mould
To where my baby doth lie.
Pretty baby, soft and fair
Round cheeks and wavy hair,
Darling one!"

By J. C. Holland
"Peace in the clover scented air
And stars within the dome;
And underneath, in dim repose,
A plain New England home.
Within, a murmur of low tones
And sighs from hearts oppressed,
Merging in prayer, at last, that brings,
The balm of silent rest."

President of the United States; a convention of peace-Democrat Copperheads
at Chicago, who will nominate Wallandigham or George B. McClellan; a con-
vention of the Tammany war-Democrats, who will repudiate the whole litter
of Copperheads; and a convention at Cleveland, of fierce, uncompromising
Fremont men. These last three will not affect the decision of the Baltimore
convention, as that will represent the majority of the people both in civil
and military life." (3)
1512 - L Apr. 27; ed:2/1 - The NEW NATION of New York city fondly suspects
that the lower it can put Lincoln and Grant, the higher Fremont shoots.
"Men are something, but principles are everythirg, and no man in the
country can compensate for the loss of victory by the Union party of the
land." (2)
1513 - L. Sept. 7; ed:2/2 - The Cleveland WORLD says that the only difference
between Republican and Democratic parties is that the Republican party is
guided by a "moral sense." - . -
"It is true that the Union party has a 'moral sense' which the Democratic
has not, and unlike the Democratic party, when the South rebels against the
'moral sense' of the civilized world, and tries to destroy the fair fabric
of American civilization, the Union party believes that justice demands
that they shall suffer whatever injury their domestic institutions may in-
cur in progress of the war. The Union men of the North do not favor slavery
and in this respect, differ most decidedly from Democracy."" (5)
1514 - L. Sept. 10; ed: 2/2 - "The proposed convention in Cincinnati on the
28th can result in no good. Either Lincoln or McClellan will be the next
President, and the issue of one party is clearly revealed while the other
is concealed. You must make a choice." (2)

1515 - L. Jan. 19; ed: 3/2 - General McClellan's nomination for presidential
candidate is just a sham. His nomination is regarded by many as merely a
suggestion or recommendation. The Democrats are to hold their next conven-
tion at Chicago. "They ought to remember that not only the place where the
Republican convention was held, but also the principles which it announced,
brought 'success to its candidate.'" - (4)
1516 - L. Feb. 27; ed: 2/1 - Attempts are being made by Democracy to shift
their base of operations from pro-slavery to anti-slavery. Leaders are
cunning enough to see that the power of slavery as a political balance
has vanished.
"The Democracy, having been long bullied by the institution of slavery,
have now a fine opportunity to flee from their cruel masters and organize
their power on the broad basis of eternal right and truth." (12)

1517 - L. Mar. 4; ed:4/1 - One of the characteristics of a "Copperhead" is
that he never loses his chance to denounce the courage of Negro troops.
"These malignant efforts to disparage the bravery of these men are worthy
of their authors." (5)
1518 - L. Mar. 24; ed: 2/1 - Miscegenation is a new name given by the radicals
to amalgamation. "The affected Democratic horror of 'miscegenation' is,
of all the rants of this canting age, the most notoriously impudent." (7)
1519 - L Apr. 14; ed: 2/1 - "Copperheads" newspapers want to promote the
success of the candidate who may be nominated in the Chicago convention and
to defeat the nominee of the Baltimore convention. "These followers of
McClellan, once in power, would be compelled either to submit to disunion
or to just such a war policy as that inaugurated by the administration."
(4)
1520 - L Apr. 15; ed:2/1 - The miscegenated Democracy is now going through
the pangs of a new birth. "They depreciate currency, they defame the Ad-
ministration, they are incessant and restless in the work of distracting the
loyal element of the North." (9)
1521 - L Apr. 23:2/1 - The policy of the "Copperheads" seems to be to em-
barrass the government. Such questions as the advance of gold and govern-
ment loans are being howled about. They cry about the burden of taxation,
criticise our army and our generals, and denounce the employment of black
soldiers.
"Thus it is that they 'fatten on garbage. ' Thus it is that the success
of the Copperheads depends upon defeat of our armies, the ruin of our fi-
nances, the delay of the war, and the dismemberment of the Union." (11)
1522 - L Apr. 28; ed: 2/1 - The primary cause of the destruction of the
Democratic party is its abandonment of principles. The manner in which
many of them still cling to the old delusion that slavery is a divine in-
stitution, and that it is the mission of the Democracy to uphold it, in
opposition to the heathen and infidel abolitionists, shows how a once
powerful parly has shipwrecked its hopes. (5)
1523 - L. May 12; ed: 2/1 - Delegates from this county and the congressional
district are to be elected this week for two conventions. "See that your
delegates chosen on Saturday night for the district convention, are men
that will represent your wishes in the convention." (5)
1524 - L. May 28; ed: 2/1 - A convention styling itself "Democratic Union,"
assembled in Louisville and adopted a series of resolutions which are
ridiculous at this time. "They smell musty. The damps of several years
are upon them. They remind one of the pompous days of the Wallandigham
democracy." (7)

1525 - L June 1; ed: 2/1 - The Democracy, since the arrest of Wallandigham
and Olds, has been in great mental destitution for the want of an arbitrary
arrest case.
"If they are dying for a case cf arbitrary arrest and think the Windsor
Saint is exhausted, we recommend the old wheel horse of Columbus and the
sainted Medary to their tender clarities." (7)
1526 - L June 1; ed:2/2 - The New York NEWS says: "The Democrats are
those who believe in the sacred and iral ienable right of sovereign states
to rule themselves. War Democrats are men who utterly repudiate the sov-
ereignty of states.
"If War Democracy has nothing better to propose than this, the people of
the states will very shortly see the difference between such pitiful
hypocrisy and the good old Democracy of Jefferson and Jackson. We prefer
the Constitution as it was, with the Union as it is." (5)
1527 - L June 14; ed: 2/1, 2 - The Chicago "Copperhead" convention probably
will be postponed. As the time approaches, the most astute and wily of
their leaders are puzzled to know what will be the most wise course for
them to adopt, the most popular platform to select, the most eligible
candidate to nominate for the sake of obtaining control of the fat offices
of the government for the next presidential term. -
"Their trouble is all use less. The people have taken the question into
their own hands, and all conventions, unless they ratify the people's
choice, are vain and idle." (10)
1528 - L June 17; ed: 2/1 - A mass meeting of the peace Democracy is to be
held in New York city. All opposed to the pending, unconstitutional war,
are invited to come.
"It is evident the peace men of New York are getting the start of the
McClellan men." (2)
1529 - L June 17; ed:2/2 - The New York WORLD says the policy of the Demo-
cratic party is that of superadling to the exercise of force, the policy
of conciliation. That is General Grant's policy. He, however, uses
bombshells to conciliate. "The Democracy don't believe in such concilia-
tion, it scems." (1)
1530 - L. June 22:4/6 - Delegates chosen to the district convention were:
C. W. Heard, Robert Boggs, U. S. Stephenson, and 37 others. (4)

Chicago convention, made a bold dash at history whilst he was floundering
in the midst of a speech illustrative of his faith. -
Wan R. Humphrey has done so much tumbling in politics within a few
years "it is not surprising he should get somewhat muddled when dealing
with the past.

1532 - L June 24; ed:2/1,2 - "The postponement of the Democratic Convention
at Chicago is regarded by the Peacemen as a triumph on their part. They
hope for the defeat of General Grant by that time, in order that the peace
element may be strengthened.
"Peace as a party cry to work upon the fears and selfishress of men,
may do, but it could not be the policy of any administration. The country
must remain one, and indivisible." (9)
1533 - L June 24:4/3 - The Democratic district convention assembled at
Brainard's hall yesterday to elect delegates to the Chicago convention. Gen.
II. H. Dodge was elected chairman. J. W. Fitch, and Judge Wan R. Humphrey
were chosen delegates. D. P. Rhodes and Morgan L. Root, E. Russell, and
S. Stephens were chosen members of the congressional executive committee.

1534 - L June 25; ed:2/4 - The postponement of the Chicago convention is
quite unfortunate for the McClellan Democrats. They acquiesce in it, but
at the same time it is fatal to the few feeble hopes they indulged in before.
"Waiting for something to turn up! Poor Copperheads." (2)
1535 - L June 28; ed: 2/2 - In 1860 the Democratic party had a disagreement
among their members, and a split took place. Now each of these two separate
Democratic parties claims to be the original party. "We suggest that one
is enough to bury them in oblivion." (7)
1536 - L June 29; ed: 1/2 - "The present posture of the Democracy is sorely
troublesome to them, as they find themselves hotly in pursuit of power with-
out any political principles to stand on.
"The only bond of union which now holds them together, is that of opposi-
tion to the ruling Power. Simply opposing without much reference to what they
oppose, will find themselves at sea in regard to the principles upon which
they should enter the coming campaign." (8)
1537 - L June 30; ed: 2/1 - The resolutions at the Chicago convention begin
with a wretched whine about the government, and the people of the North's
violation of the constitution.
The second resolution professing devotion to slavery calls for a revoca-
tion of all emancipation and confiscation proclamations, and demands the
return to slavery of all Negro soldiers.
"This is a poor ground of opposition they have selected in which finally
to bury themselves, fathoms deep, in ever lasting infamy, and oblivion."
(11)
1538 - L. July 9:2/1 - The Democratic party will attempt to bring the ques-
tion of slavery up in the coming election. Certain Demccrats try to prove
the constitution to be a guardian of a species of state rights which protects
Rebels from the consequences of war. (2)

1539 - L July 14:2/1 - The coming Chicago convention is causing much excite-
ment and interest. New York Democracy is trying very hard to inaugurate
McClellan against Grant.
McClellan's serenade at Troy and Lake George is to revive faith in him
in time for the convention, and from present indications he is likely to be
chosen. "What means the Champions of Peace here in Ohio, that they do not
watch this flank movement of McClellan's Men?" (8)
1540 - L July 15; ed:2/1 - The Democratic party at the present time is liken-
ed unto a character that John Milton wrote about, who preferred darkness to
light. Democrats are ready to pledge themselves that the Rebellion does
not interfere with slavery which has been a bone of contention in this
country for 80 years, and a ruling power of the Rebellion.
"By yielding to Davis and Lee they confess to the world that the idea
of popular self-government is a delusion and splendid farce." (8)
1541 - L July 21:2/1 - Democratic congressman of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and
Indiana issued a manifesto written by Senator Buckalew of Pennsylvania.
The charges, among other things, are that the government interfered with
clections. They denounced conscription and the bounty system, regarded
the government as oppressive, insecure, and corrupt, and demanded that the
races should be kept unmixed.
The sum of the whole matter is: "The defeat of Mr. Lincoln removes the
main obstacle to reunion and restores at once the jusst rule of the Constitu-
tion over the adhering states. This analysis speaks for itself." (11)
1542 - L. July 23; ed:4/1 - After a survey of certain activities of the Demo-
cratic party, we suggest that a new platform, "strong and broad enough to
hold and sustain what is left of the party," be built at the Chicago conven-
tion. -
"We are not sure, but the materials for a platform at Chicago may be ob-
tained from some old planks that must be introduced. Alas! for some poli-
tical joiner to put them togeiher." (13)
1543 - L July 30; ed:4/5 - The spirit of the "Copperhead" convention held
in Crawford county, July 29, was resistant to the government. They are
afraid of the coming draft, and are getting bold enough to talk of resistance.
Such a demonstration as that at Bucyrus shows the ramifications of the
great conspiracy." - (5)
1544 - L. Aug. 10; ed: 2/1 - Interest increases as the Democratic convention
in Chicago draws near. McClellan's leaders and the peace wings are waging
a fierce battle to gain mastery of the convention. It is impossible at this
time to predict the nomination, but McClellan's chances look favorable.
"Whoever the nominee may be, unless he is placed upon the platform of
the unconditional submission of the rebels, he will be overwhelmingly de-
feated. The loyal men of the North are not willing to let their sacrifices
be in vain, by reason of a lot of sniveling, whimpering howlers for peace
at any price." - (10)

1545 - L. Aug. 15; ed: 2/1 - Democrats have been trying a new Union dodge
in Ottawa county. Reports from the union indicate that a meeting was held
in Grand Haven for the purpose of forming a "People's Peace" association,
which is from beginning to end, a Democratic movement and nothing else.
The phrase, "irrespective of party," was thrown in as a mere attempt to
gull somebody; as they did with the Union movement two years ago. (2)
1546 - L Aug. 15; ed: 2/1 - The party to meet at the Democratic convention
in Chicago is composed of that portion of the Democratic party which was
for liberty and the Union when the war began. Because of party prejudices
they have become Southern sympathizers again.
Men from a class of respectable loyalty are to be brought together and
a union of conflicting elements to be achieved.
Wide differences of opinion as to candidates and principles exist and
the Democratic press urges the necessity of a union. It is feared that a
division will take place.
"We scarcely think a division probable although a union upon a candidate
or platform at Chicago will be one of the most astonishing things ever
accomplished." (11)
1547 - L Aug. 18; ed: 1/2 - Rebels and Rebel sympathizers look upon the atti-
tude of the Democracy with approval, but American citizens in the army feel
that the attitude of the Democracy toward them is the chief cause of their
failure to overthrow the Rebellion. Leaders of the Democracy have opposed
taxation necessary to support their widows, mothers, and sisters. They also
opposed taxation necessary to maintain the currency and the pay of soldiers
in the field. They are 1,0w anxious to see what can be done to gain the
soldier's votes.
"The people intend to lift up their hands and prove to the world that
there is a might and power in their arms that is not to be overpowered by
Rebel hordes, North or South." (10)
1548 - L. Aug. 19; ed:2/2 - Democratic orators have a hobby of harping on
the war. According to them our war is wretchedly managed and defeat is ours
on every hand. While they find plenty to complain about, they never offer
any better measures, and they oppose every measure that is successfui.
"We should be glad to think the Democratic Party more sincerely for the
Union, did not facts belie such an idea. With what justice and reason can
party leaders complain about the conduct of the war, when everything necessary
for the triumphant close of the war meets their bitter hostility." (11)
1549 - L Aug. 20; ed: 2/1 - Wallandigham, representative of western Democracy,
in a speech at a peace meeting in Syracuse, insisted that there be no
division of the Democracy at the Chicago convention, and is in favor of
putting the presidential issue before the people as "Peace cr War." He
says that peace is to be had through an armistice.
"If the Democratic party Coes before the people on this issue, it will be
necessary for them to consider the probable consequences of such an armistice.

"We should be glad to believe the above if it were possible, but the
history and present make-up of the Democratic party is not favorable to
such a desire. We suspect the PLAIN DEALER'S standard of ability and purity
is a very inferior one, if the Copperheads that go there from the West are
the finest specimens that can be presented. Men whose course has been
calculated to delay the war and prevent restoration of the Union, are
neither very able nor very pure." - (4)
1552 - L. Aug. 29; ed:2/2 - The opinion as indicated by advices from all
quarters is to the effect that McClellan will carry the convention with
probably a large majority of votes. Although other nominations are to take
place, little attention is paid to them.
"The selection of a platform will be the great rock on which the Democrat-
ic party will split and on the question of peace and war are as far apart as
the poles, and are very much in doubt as io what they shall make their mea-
sure. . Either way there is dissatisfaction - either way leads to death." -

1553 - L. Aug. 30; ed: 1/2 - The Chicago convention has finished its first
day, but nothing very important transpired. There is much excitement, how-
ever, with bands playing and politicians making speeches.
"The real fight will be over a platform and we expect a field battle
today over the question whether platform or candidate shall be first de-
cided upon. We are inclined from omens to presage a victory for peace men,

1554 - L. Aug. 30; ed: 2/4 - The leaders of the Rebellion are Democrats and
a Democratic administration was in power when the Rebellion was determined
upon. Also, recent discoveries and arrests in Indiana involve none but -
Democrats, and yet the Democratic party has the assurance to ask to be taken
into public confidence again. \3)

1555 - L Aug. 31; ed: 2/1 - The anxiety of Rebel leaders over the results
of the Chicago convention is keenly felt, because they realize that
their last hope rests with the success of the "Peace" party at the com- .
ing elections. Their resources gone and their treasury depleted, their
last chance lies in the disorganization of the North.
"It must be humiliating to our Democratic brethren to be dictated
to by Rebels in arms, but the sense of shame is a forgotten one with
Copperhead leaders, and we have no doubt that they will eat their
humble pie without a blush, and meekly submit to the mastership of their
chivalric Virginia owners." - (12)
1556 - L. Sept. 1; ed: 2/2 - "Solomen was mistaken. There is a new power
under the sun - a prayer in a Democratic Convention." Reverend Dr.
Clarkson delivered a very apropriate and earnest prayer, really a
missionary work, as some of the "unwashed and unterrified" had never
heard a prayer before. (4)
1557 - L Sept. 3; ed:2/2 - The character of a political party is often in-
dicated by what it leaves unsaid, more than by what it affirms.
The Democratic party leaves in doubt by concealment what it is im-
portant to know.
The subject of slavery was entirely ignored in the Democratic plat-
form and is covered up by ambiguous phrases about rights of states.
People are left in doubt as to what Democratic leaders would do in case
the government were left in their hands.
"The silence of the Democratic party is therefore very suspicious
and criminal. It convicts a party, usually bold in avowing its sentiments,
of a most craven suppliance. It shows a disposition to crawl upon the
dust under the feet of traitors, assassins and murderers such as Jeff
Davis." (18)
1558 - L. Sept. 6:4/3 - A meeting was held in Hal thorth's hall Sept. 3,
and the McClellan club organized. J. S. Allen was elected president;
Charles Winslow, vice president; Frank Kelly, secretary; and William
Goodwin, treasurer. (3)
1559 - L. Sept. 6; ed: 2/3 - The New York WORLD is alarmed at the manner
in which the Chicago platform is being denounced by the people, and fears
that if the discussion continues nothing visible will be left of "Little
Mac." - -
Efforts of the Democratic party have been to prove that the measures
adopted are unwise, and they must not shrink from the issue.
"If an immediate cessation of hostilities is a good thing, it is a
good thing now when Sherman has taken Georgia, and Grant has hold of
the throat of Richmond." (4)
1560 - L. Sept. 10; ed: 2/1 - The object of the convention to be held in
Cincinnati Sept. 28 is to reassert the true doctrine of Democracy and
to decide what it is best to do in the coming presidential election.

POLITICAL PARTIES - Democratic (Cont'd)
"The reaction against the followers of the aristocratic law, Belmont,
has already set in like a tidal wave, and the sources, whence the
Democratic chieftains calculated to draw victory have failed." (5)
1561 - L. Sept. 12; ed: 2/1 - Efforts to hold together the inconsistencies of
the peace platform have proved so absurd and so ridiculous as to meet with
the scorn of all Demºcrats who hold to a consistent policy. Never before,
in political history was there such a scheme of bulnbugging the people; the
whole affair is just a trap to catch the unthinking crowds. All intelligent
Americans who desire genuine peace will not be deceived.
"The ruptures in the Democratic party show how rotten the bonds are
which hold it together, and tell Union men that it is only necessary to
hold together to insure them triumph and a speedy return of Peace." (8)
1562 - L. Sept. 12:4/4 - A grand rally was held in the National hall
Sept. 10 by the Democrats. A small crowd of "Copperheads" attended.
"Of its soundness on all Copperhead principles there could be no doubt,
from the cheering at every argument for peace, and every sneer for the
'nigger' soldiers." The "Temperance" band was there, and being more
loyal than the crowd, played "The Star Spangled Banner" and "The Red
White and Blue."
The meeting was opened by a series of resolutions which started with
a denunciation of the present administration, and declared that their
only hope lies in a change of administration. Another resolution de-
clared that the object of the war sluould be the "Union as it was and
the constitution as it is." The resolutions were unanimously adopted.
(19)
1563 - L. Sept. 19; ed:2/1 - August Belmont, chairman of the "Copperhead"
national executive committee of the Democratic party, is an Austrian
Jew, and a financial agent of the well-known house of Rothschild in
Europe, which holds Confederate bonds purchased for almost nothing.
This committee is endeavoring, through Belmont, to bring about a ces-
sation of hostilities based upon granting everything asked for by the
South. It wants the national government to assume the Confederate
debt, which will add much to the already fabulous wealth of that great
house by increasing the value of its bonds.
"The Rothschilds know that the re-election of Lincoln will result in
the suppression of the rebellion and the worthlessness of confederate
bonds. It remains to be seen what success these foreign Shylocks will
meet." (6)
1564 - L. Sept. 22; ed: 2/1 - The pet phrase of Democratic orators and
newspapers is quite significant in one respect in that it ignores the
constitution. Heretofore, it has been a hobby with the opposition
that the constitution must be preserved, but it seems now that it is
not indispensable to them.
"This must be the result of an understanding made at Niagara Falls
by Copperheads, to the effect that the Montgomery Constitution should be
adopted, or a new one be made, better suited to the Democracy, North and
South." (4)

POLITICAL PARTIES - Democratic (Cont'd)
1565 - L. Sept. 28; ed: 2/2 - The principles enunciated in the Niagara
Falls platform are not argued by Democratic leaders any longer, but they
are now trying to malign the men who are working, honestly and unceasingly,
for the Union. They try to blind the people to the shameful doctrines
advocated in that platform, the leading idea of which is cessation of
hostilities with views of an ultimate convention of the states.
"We have failed to see an attempt by Copperheads to defend the
dignity or feasibility of such a convention, and recent triumphs of
Union armies have made them ashamed to discuss the Niagara Platform."
(5)
1566 - L Oct. 4; ed: 2/4 - The Democratic party at the Chicago convention
seemed thoroughly paralyzed. Had the convention declared for the one-
term principle, and in a calm and dignified way arrayed itself against
Lincoln in favor of Generals Dix or Sherman, "it might have struck the
keynote of popular sympathy, and swept away every vote in the electoral
college. But lured by our despondency and confident of triumph it
followed the evil counsels of Wallandigham, Powell and Pendleton - it
declared the war a failure, and spoke for peace at any price."
McClellan's letter to acceptance, exhibits the best side of the
Democracy. It says: "The Union is the one condition of peace." If hy
peace he does not mean restoration, he means nothing at all. If he does
mean restoration, he makes the laying down of arms and the return to
allegiance its only condition. An armistice between belligerents must
be entered into by the highest authorities on either side. Not until
the leaders of the Confederacy are dethroned, inquisition crushed, and
the shackles removed from the people's limbs and lips by federal arms,
will the masses learn to see and act for themselves and return to their
old and true allegiance. (22)
1567 - L. Oct. 11; ed: 2/2 - The Hebrew writer in the PLAIN DEALER indig-
nantly takes exception to the LEADER'S speaking of Belmont as a Jew.
He says that Belmont is not a Jew, but a Christian, and married to a
Christian woman.
"We do not wonder that they feel insulted. We as Christians are
ashamed that he belongs to our race." (2)
1568 - L Oct. 14; ed: 2/1 - Anyone taking the trouble to compare the
theory expounded at Chicago and the theory that is being carried out by
the "rebels through the instrumentality of armed rebellion," will dis-
cover that the "doctrines avowed at Chicago are such as the rebels them-
selves have no trouble in affirming with gun and bayonet."
The Rebels and the "Copperheads" agree in their views on the way in
which the subject of exchanging prisoners was treated, and declare that
the government should abandon its black soldiers to whatever fate the
Rebels see fit to impose upon them. They both agree that it was cruel to
arm the black men and insist upon making an exchange without reference to
negro soldiers. -
"The doctrines enunciated in the form of resolutions at Chicago might
result in active co-operation with the South. The logical sequence of the

wicked rebellion, a wicked rebellion in theory is fighting the Union

1569 - L Oct. 28:4/5 - The Demccracy of the third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth wards met last night at Euclid and Brownell sts. with lanterns,
banners, and music, and proceeded to the home of Mr. Noble. On arriving,
the band played the "Star Spangled Banner" and gave three cheers for
Noble. Their next stop was at the residence of the Hon. H. B. Payne
and the band serenaded him with "When the Cruel War is Over." After the
cheering ceased, Payne congratulated the crowd on the mighty reduction
of the "Abolition" majorities, and said that one more such victory as
that of the late election would lay the Abolitionists at the feet of
the Democrats. He also told them that they must not relax until McClellan
is elected. At the conclusion of Mr. Payne's speech, the crowd proceed-
ed to the home of F. T. Backus. This worthy gentleman held forth in
speech until most all of the lanterns burned out, and tired serenaders
lost their enthusiasm. (24)
1570 - L Nov. 1; ed: 2/1 - Allies of the Democracy are found in every
part of the world, and appeals are made to Rebel armies to move forward
to victory with a view to insure Democratic success. "Democratic leaders
know this and therefore depreciate our victories and magnify the successes
of the Rebels." (6)
1571 - L Nov. 2; ed:2/1 - There is a "Pro-Slavery" party in the North
which, under pretense of devotion to the Union, and of opposition to
the way the war is carried on, conceals what is really at the founda- -
tion of their party principles: Their desire to have slavery established
as the law of the land.
"How then can any man who loves freedom and hates slavery, be found
in sympathy with modern Democracy? It cannot be done. It is impossible."
(14)
1572 - L. Nov. 10; ed:4/2 - Some of the disappointed "Copperheads" are
talking about the reassembling of the Chicago convention. "All we have
to say is that if the Chicago Convention is recalled for the purpose of
inaugurating any revolutionary measures it will be the duty of the
Government to arrest Belmont and all his crew." (10)
1573 - L Nov. 12; ed:2/2 - The Democratic party is no longer a living
party, as the doctrines on which it conducted the recent campaign have
been repudiated by the whole country. The thunder and lightning of the
party are used up. There can be no issue for four years to distract
the North, except that of the best way to put down armed resistance to
the government. "Let all good citizens render a cordial support to the
government." -

things have quieted down a great deal, but in some quarters a feeble
attempt is being made to put new life into dead issues, which can never
be resurrected. "No public effort of the New York NEWS and others can
vivify them again." It is rumored that some wily leaders, seeing ruin
unless they retrace their steps, have decided to take radical and ad-
vanced ground on the subject of slavery and the war. They propose to
take the lead in abolishing slavery by an amendment to the constitution,
thus snatching salvation from the confusion of their overthrow.
"This is their only hope. Had they nominated Grant or Dix, and
planted themselves on the side of Freedom, today they might have been
masters of the hour." (6)

dailies in St. Louis, have advanced the name of General Fremoni for
president. An attempt to nominate him at the national convention, which
will be held in Cleveland, May 10, will be made. The movement is a
further development of the convention of radical Germans held here last
fall. (2)
1576 - L Mar. 23; ed: 2/1 - The whole radical German organization does
not amount to over 2,000 persons. "If the Germans refuse to vote for
Lincoln, it will but slightly affect results." (6)
1577 - L. Apr. 18; ed:2/1 - Friends of General Fremont are to hold a

incessant propagandism from man to man tending to convince the people
that they must rely on themselves.
"The entire strength of the Union men must be combined in order to
insure an overwhelming defeat cf all adversaries." (10)
1578 - L. May 9; ed: 2/1 - The sorehead convention will be held in Cleve-
land May 31. These anti-Lincoln inen will nominate a candidate for pres-
ident to run in opposition to the Baltimore nnminee. A glance at the list
of names will show a most incongruous lot of names, consisting of many
nationalities and representatives of all the old parties.
"A curt examination of the list will give one a good idea of the

one or two exceptions, most gloriously unknown to fame. They are all
evidently soreheads... mad against the Adulinistraticn about something."

land Convention will be a most formidable gathering. Our Albany cor-
respondent, who has excellent means for knowing, states that there will
be from Missouri alone, two thousand delegates, of whom one thousand
will be from the city of St. Louis." "The above, from the New York
WORLD, is a sample of the kind of puffing bestowed upon the Fremont
Convention by the Copperheads. There is not a particle of truth in
the statement and it is published merely to assist in swelling the
numbers." - (6)
1581 - L. May 30:4/5 - The Clevelard convention is to meet in Cleveland
tomorrow in the interests of John C. Fremont. They have no local habi-
tation, and no organization in the city is favorable to the movement. .
Probably there will be 500 to 1,000 delegates attending. . . . . (8)

we are quite certain that Abraham Lincoln will forward them immediately
to the theatre of their future triumphs - to the uplands of Mexico." (9)

political movement of modern times was to be set on foot, a new party
be formed, and the next President nominated - a day more fatal to
Abraham Lincoln than the Ides of March to Caesar. -- -
"The day certainly passed off with most remarkable quiet. Besides
the arrivals chronicled yesterday, but few made their appearance, and
the convention, for one so widely heralded and anxiously prepared for,
was singularly small in numbers and weak in talent."
The convention inet at eleven o'clock at Chapin's hall. "The two

posed that they stopped at Cincinnati for consultation with the proprietor -

thousand from New York were similarly missing, and the convention was
in numbers a very slim affair....

irrepressible conflict between the friends of General Grant, including
most of the New York delegation and many from the Eastern States, who
were mainly of Democratic antecedents, and those of General Fremont,
composed mainly of the old abolitionists and the radical Germans,
and led by Coionel Moss, of Missouri."
E. Gilbert, president of the New York "Fremont" club, called the
convention to order and immediately nominated ex-Governor Johnston of
Pennsylvania as temporary chairman. Johnston was elected by acclama-
tion. B. H. Brooks of California and S. Wolf of Washington were
chosen secretaries. A committee on permanent organization, of ten
members, was appointed.
The number of delegates attending the convention was so small that
the committee appointed to enroll their names never made its report.
"We believe, however, that there were about one hundred and fifty dele-
gates present, of whom nearly half were from Missouri and wild for
Fremont, and ihe others mainly from New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois."
In addressing the convention, General Cochrane said, in part: "You
assemble here intending to support the army in the field, and at the
same time to organize a great civil army to fight for principles, and
to save for all generations the precious legacy obtained for us by the
sacrifices of the soldiers of the Union. The rebellion, it must be
suppressed; the Union, it must be preserved."
The nomination of Grant "was very faintly cheerei, and it was evident
that the name of the hero of Spottsylvania would pale before that of
the swordless general of New York.
"Nothing would do however, for the St. Louis Germans, who voted not
to recognize God's hand in war, but to nominate Fremont.
"General Fremont was nominated by acclamation.
"The 3,000 delegates, with whom the city was said to swarm yesterday
by the imaginative PLAIN DEALER, cheered heartily over the good work."
General Cochrane was nominated by acclamation for vice president. The
naming of the party was deferred until night when a committee, appointed
in the afternoon, reported the name of the new party to be the Radical
Democracy. Bird B. Chapman represented Ohio on the executive committee,
consisting of 15 members. (128)
1584 - L June 2; ed:2/1 - The "Fremont" convention held here May 31 was
given wide publicity by the Democratic press throughout the country, but
its slimness and insignificance was a surprise even to those who knew how
feeble the whole affair would be.
The authorized delegates present did not exceed 200. Of the six
or eight individuals who manipulated the convention only General Cochrane
of New York was f any national prominence. -
The state of Missouri, in which a rabid red Republicanism finds ex-
istence, virtually controlled the convention.
The object of the convention, aside from gratifying a spite toward
President Lincoln, was to affirm a more radical policy than any yet
enunciated, and to put forward a man who will carry the policy into
effect.

Mr. Foster, the special champion of radical views, was obliged to
confess in his speech Tuesday (May 29) that the Republican party holds
the same views on the subject of slavery as expressed in the Fremont
platform.
The doctrines laid down in the Fremont platform, those that are
vital, will all be substantially affirmed at Baltimore, (the Republican
convention.) Their realization will be much sooner attained by a strict
unity of the Union party, than by such a disorganizing scheme as the
one inaugurated in Cleveland.
"We have commented thus at length, not from any apprehension, ...
but from the conviction that the Copperheads... will endeavor to fan the
whole affair into importance.
"The Convention, in a word, was made up of oily politicians from
New York, impetuous, hair-brained Germans from St. Louis, several
venerable abolitionists... together with an admixture of personal friends
and parasites of Fremont, all controlled by one feeling - that of hatred
for Abraham Lincoln." - - (18)
1585 - L June 3; ed: 1/1 - The Chicago TIMES says that the Cleveland
Fremont convention at Chapin's hall had more than 2,000 delegates,
and followed by saying the convention hall was filled. The New York
WORLD writes that this hall will hold 3,000.
"The hall will not hold more than six hundred at the outside, and
at no time was it more than two-third full." - - (6)
1586 - L June 3; ed: 1/2 - The Cleveland Fremont convention was made up
of pro-slavery politicians like Cochrane, worn-out Democratic backs
like Bird Chapman, and thieving speculators like McKinstry.
They protest "love of the Union and hatred of slavery, while their
official organs, in essence as well as in appearance, are the New York
WORLD and the Chicago TIMES." (11)
1587 - L. June 3; ed: 2/1 - Article 12, Sec. 1, of the amendment of the
constitution proposed at the Fremont convention says: "The electors
shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for president
and vice president, one of whom at least shall not be inhabitant of
the same state with themselves." -
"Cochrane and Fremont are both of New York, and in the event of
their carrying their own state, the electors on their ticket would have
to take their choice between the two, being constitutionally disqualified
from voting for both." (4)
1588 - L June 7; ed: 2/1 - Fremont announced that in the event of the
nomination of Lincoln at Baltimore he will accept the nomination of
the Cleveland convention.
"Of course he will. The man who sent all his friends from every
quarter to the convention here to nominate him, at whose suggestion
and in whose interest it was gotten up, who paid its running expenses,
and who contrived and, by means of his tools, maraged the whole affair,
solely and entirely that he might receive the nomination, would not
be likely to refuse it." (6)

nomination of the convention, seals his political fate, and dishonors
his name."
He gratifies the Copperheads' sympathetic feeling for the Rebels by
stating that he "does not heartily concur" in that portion of the Cleve-
land platform which sets forth that "confiscation of the lands of the reb-
els, and their distribution among the soldiers and actual settlers, is
a measure of justice." (5)
1590 - L June 16; ed: 2/1 - Fremont, in his letter of acceptance, says
nothing of continuing the war and is very guarded on the subject of
confiscation. He has already attracted the drowning Democracy. The
New York NEWS contains a letter signed "Peace Democrat," favoring the
nomination of Fremont. "It would not be at all surprising if this
should be done at Chicago." (2)
1591 - L June 17:2/1 - The NEW NATION writes regarding the Fremont and
Cochrane party that there is so little difference between them and the
Democratic party, that it would be easy to adopt a common ticket.
"The NEW NATION is right in saying there is no difference between the
two parties. They are alike as two peas, as the two Dromios, or as one
body with two faces that resemble each other." (2)

support of Fremont, now regards it as his duty to defend the character
and work of the Cleveland convention.
Mr. Tilton of the INDEPENDENT, strongly opposed to Mr. Lincoln
before the Baltimore convention, after it, sustains him and criticizes
the men and spirit of the Cleveland Fremont convention.
Mr. Phillips felt obliged to lecture his young friend Tilton, who in
return fairly "picked Mr. Phillips to pieces" in a cutting reply.
"We regret to see a man like Mr. Phillips allowing his personal
prejudices against Mr. Lincoln so completely to warp his judgement on
questions so vital to the Republic. After this severe chastisement at
the hands of Mr. Tilton, we hope to see him converted from the error -
of his ways." (12)

some people hope to shake the widespread confidence of the people in

POLITICAL PARTIES - Union (Cont'd)
held in Brainard's hall. The only other candidate for delegate was
Senator Williamson.
Senator Williamson was not at the convention. When he was called upon
to express his opinion on a candidate for the presidency, William Fuller
spoke in his behalf, stating his understanding of Mr. Williamson's position
to be that he is in favor of the nomination of Mr. Lincoln, but would not
pledge himself to continue voting for him if circumstances should show
some other man to be a stronger candidate.
Judge S. II. Pitkin explained Mr. Upson's unavoidable absence from the
convention and stated that he was for Mr. Lincoln, first, last, and all
the time, but that he would support the nominee of the convention.
Judge Tilden was the only candidate for delegate who addressed the
convention.
He said he was very free to state his preferences on the question of
support. He said be had no desire to go to Baltimore, and had no idea of
going without clearly defining his position and knowing that it represented
the views of a majority of the convention. He declared himself in favor of
the nomination of Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Tilden lad opposed Mr. Lincoln's
nomination at Chicago, but said he had since watched his course carefully
and believed him to be as pure a man as had ever held the administration
of a government in his hands.
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Tilden added, "by his course, his calmness, his far-
sightedness," had fused and arrayed all parties against the mightiest cf
rebellions.
Judge Barr enquired if Judge Tilden would abide by the nomination of the
Baltimore convention, and made a reference to the convention of 1848, which
nominated General Taylor.
Judge Tilden explained his course at that convention in full, and
admitted that in obedience to the instructions of the convention which
nominated him, he did make an ass of himself and bolt the ticket, voting
for Mr. Wan Buren.
Seth A. Marshall, Lake county, was nominated by acclamation as pre-
sidential elector for the district. Peter Thatcher, jr., was chosen as
alternate delegate for Judge Tilden. John Johnston, Summit county, was
unanimously elected the alternate of Mr. Upson.
"The following resulution, offered by the Hon. John Crowell, was adopted
with overwhelming unanimity:
"That this convention has undiminished confidence in the wisdom and
patriotism of President Lincoln and his administration, and that the people
demand his renomination at the Baltimore convention."
Permanent organization of the conver,tion was affected when a committee
report naming H. S. Stevens of Cuyahoga, president, was adopted. Vice
presidents of the convention were Theodore Brock, Cuyahoga county; Simeon
Perkins, Summit county; and John Murray, Lake county. Secretaries were:
J. C. Grannis, Cuyahoga county; W. W. Nevison, Lake County; and E. P. Green,
Summit county. (36)

"It is not however, in the nomination of a candidate for the Presidency
that the convention will find their sagacity most taxed. On that point
the people have already spoken, with a unanimity and enthusiasm unparal-
leled in our former history, and the convention will only ratify their
decision. In carrying out this duty, the convention will without doubt re-
nominate Lincoln, on their first ballot or by acclamation, for re-election
to the Presidency. It is in the celection of a platform that the conven-
tion will find the chief exercise of its experience and wisdom." (17)
1607 - L June 7:2/2, 3 - The list of delegates from Ohio to the Union

re-election." (9)

position in the Baltimore Convention." (5)

chosen as chairman of the national committee of the Union party. "He will
make a splendid campaign." (1)
1611 - L June 16; ed: 2/3 - The New York TIMES says, "The farmers, as the
London JOURNAL rightly judges, have shaped the policy, through its whole
history, of the Republican and Union party."
"It is certainly true that the pure and healthy-minded people of the
rural districts are the great reservoirs whence cities draw their best
men, whether in business, in law, or in politics." (6)
1612 - H July 5; ed:4/1 - The Union congressional convention recommended
Schuyler Colfax. "Mr. Colfax well deserves the honor of such a nomination."
(2)
1613 - L. Aug. 3; ed:4/1 - In a short time most of the Union congressional
district conventions will meet for the purpose of nominating candidates for
election to Congress, and too much importance cannot be placed on the
results. It is essential to Union arms and the final success of liberty
and justice that candidates for president and vice president of the Union
party be successful. It is just as important that both houses of Congress
co-operate in their efforts to suppress the Rebellion.
It is predicted that 14 of the 19 districts of Ohio will elect Union
representatives at the coming election. Let not a single effort be spared
to make proper nominations and to have them elected. The "Copperhead"
opposition will be on the alert. Their leaders are skilled and un-
scrupulous.
We trust that the present members of the Union from this state will be
renominated. (18)
1614 - L. Aug. 5; ed:2/3 - There is a movement in Butler county to hold
another presidential convention, and nominate a candidate other than
President Lincoln.
The above movement of the disaffected of Butler county can bave but one
result; to make mischief, and to weaken the Union ticket. But this
movement clearly demonstrates the grievous error made in holding the
Union convention at so early a day. (9)
1615 - L Aug. 11:4/2 - "Union voters of the 18th Congressional district,
consisting of the counties of Cuyahoga, Summit, a nd Lake, are requested to
meet at their usual place of holding elections, on Saturiay, Aug. 20, to
elect delegates to the District Convention to be held in Cleveland, Aug.
25, at Brainard's hall, for the purpose of nominating one Congressman, and
for such other business as may be brought before the Convention. Each
county, under the apportionment agreed upon, will be entitled to one
delegate for every hundred votes cast for Governor Brough at the last state
election, and one for each fraction of fifty or upwards. This will entitle
the several counties to the following number of delegates:

1627 - L. Jan. 1; ed: 2/1 - Democratic politicians and New York newspapers
support the establishment of an independent nation in the South.
We quote from John Stuart Mill's article in FRASER'S magazine for
December, 1859, in order to refute them. Mill said: "The sacred duties
which civilized nations owe to the independence and nationality of each
other are not binding toward those to whom nationality is a certain evil
or a questionable good." . . . -
(LEADER) "A nationality has no right to build a government upon a
'corner stone' of slavery. Subjugation of the South by our armies is
justified." (7)
1628 - L. Jan. 9; ed: 2/1 - Some men believe that the profession of
politics is a mean and unworthy one. They may admit that the calling of
a politician or statesman, and in the higher sense these are synonymous,
is an able or useful one, but believe that the affairs of state have
gotten into such a condition that honest men cannot afford to be as-
sociated with politics or politicians. "Because had men deal with
politics, that therefore the good must not, is the shallowest talk of
every shallow men." - - - (16)
1629 - L Feb. 26; ed: 2/1 - A certain class of Americans style themselves
"conservatives," in opposition to what they call "radicals." They
believe that primarily, conservatism means holding back in the traces.
"Conservatism is preservatism, but of all that Inakes the power and
glory of a nation. It is liberty we wish to conserve unto all men."

POLITICS &amp; GOVERNMENT (Cont'd)
1630 - L. May 31; ed: 1/1, 2 - Mill, in his argument on representative
government, says the three essential conditions in any people in order
to have such a government are: First, people must be willing to accept
this form of government; second, the people so choosing sha il be ready
to defend their choice by personal exposure to danger if need be; and
last but not least the people must exercise the power of self restraint.
This must be possessed in order to exercise the privilege of general
suffrage.
"I hese qualities, so deeply inwrought into our people, have been the
fruit of our liberal institutions, of our education, and our Christianity."
(12)
1631 - L Oct. 22; ed: 2/2 - The New York WORLD is trying hard to over-
come objections to a convention of states. It admits that state sov-
ereignty is opposed by the North but approved by the South. The WORLD
also tries to show that the same doctrines of state sovereignty has been
held at different times in history, but has repeatedly died out, its
former defenders becoming its bitterest enemies. It also says "that
if the Union can be restored this metaphysical opinion of the South
would ultimately, by reason of self interest, die out in the South."
(LEADER) "This is all a very nice bit of reasoning, but it is un-
sound in starting with the assumption that the Union could be restored
and the virtual independence of rebel States be recognized before a
convention of States was called. A convention of States predicated
upon an admission of the right of any State to secede and consequent
justification of the rebellion, never could result in restoration of
the Union except on such terms as the rebels might see fit to dictate
as conditions of their return. The recognition of the right of a State
to secede Inight be salve to Southern pride, but it would never result in
restoration of the Union." (12)
1632 - L. Nov. 16; ed: 2/1 - "When, in the centuries to come, the his-
torian digs up fossi liferous deposits of the year 1864, the Mastodon
discovered will be the Democratic doctrine of State rights. State
Sovereignty, in the sense of the Chicago gentlemen, is forever dead, and
will hereafter be the great political fossil of 1864." (3)
1633 - L. Nov. 19; ed: 2/1 - A government embalmed in the affections of
the people and whose armies are a free gift and numbered by the hundred
thousand is stronger than any planted on the bayonets of unwilling
subjects. "When we shall again be a united and free people, the Republic
embalmed in the affections of fifty million people, who can withstand the
march of free institutions throughout tile world." (5)
1634 - L Nov. 19; ed:2/1 - The only obstacle in the way of abolishing
slavery in the South is the stubborn and unreasonable will of the wicked
leaders, concealing their objections to one Union under the plea that the
idea of state sovereignty is an essential docirine of the constitution.

The people of the North will never consent to the doctrine to let a
state secede whenever it may see fit. They will pursue it until it is
annihilated. If the government shall offer peace and reunion to the
South with the condition that slavery be removed, and leaders refuse
acquiescence, it would result in the pursuance of the Rebellion with
more fury than ever. (16)
1635 - L Dec. 5; ed: 2/1 - The peace "Copperheads" of the North have, for
some time, advocated the doctrine of state sovereignty, as indicated by
their great organ, the NEWS. "This idea of State supremacy and Nation
subjugation is all wrong, and nine-tenths of the people of the North
feel this way about it." (4)

1636 - L June 29; ed: 2/1 - An effort is being made to inaugurate a new

assembly in numbers proportionate to the population and resources of

while sitting together, and then to resolve themselves into local

"Why should they not, in time, unite their fortunes with those of

1637 - L. Mar. 15: ed:4/4 - During the time of the fair, when thousands
came by, 2,675 persons signed the petition for general emancipation and
an amendment to the constitution. A Women's Loyal league should be
organized in this city, as in all cities of the North, to show the South
that we are determined not only to put down Rebellion by the bayonet,
but to establish freedom and a fair government by law and constitution.
No better system can be found to educate our people in the genius
of a people's government than that of petitioning. Here the voice of
each is heard and received as competent testimony. (5)
England
1638 - L. May 28; ed: 2/1 - Republicanism is the theme of general con-

"This is a great step and indicates the strength of the Republican
feeling in England." (4)

Jllinois
1640 - L Dec. 1; ed: 2/1 - One immediate result of a Union victory in
Illinois must be the abolition of the black code of that state. Under
the existing laws, free colored men are punished by being sold as
slaves for 12 months, and persons who harbor colored freemen or slaves
are penalized heavily. "We presume this law must now be a dead letter,
but it still disgraces the State and the Legislature should immediately
repeal it. We are about to abolish slavery by amendment to the Con-
stitution, but we must also rid ourselves of the Slave spirit in the
free North." (3)
Kentucky
1641 - L. Dec. 12; ed:2/2 - Signs exhibited in Kentucky promise to
place it in the list of free states before many years. Among the latest
developments is the call for the Union state convention to organize
the Union party on a stronger anti-slavery basis. The constitution of
Kentucky provides that slaves cannot be freed without their owner's
consent, or the payment of the full value of the slaves. The slave
hoiders are urged, therefore, to signify their desire for the emanci-
pation of Negroes in the coming kentucky legislature.
A clause in the constitution requiring deportation of slaves from
the state is regarded as not applying to the mode of emancipation by
consent of slave holders. -
"It is all nonsense to think of deporting all blacks to Africa; we
need them in this country as laborers. Men might as well talk about
deportation of mules and horses." (14)

soon as it became possible to understand how far the WORLD and JOURNAL

1655 - L. Jan. 25; ed:2/1 - Success has attended the popular five 20
loans and secured the sympathies and loyalty of many. This indicates
the faith of the people in the stability of their government. This
loan has been procured at a lower rate of interest than is paid on the
previous loans.
The love of money is no doubt a root of evil, but also may be made
a root of much good in uniting under one nationality a people who might
otherwise be rent asunder by the fierce commotions of sectional interest
and sectional prejudice. (9)
1656 - L. Mar. 31; ed: 2/1 - Congress, after spending months in making
Buncombe speeches, is beginning to think the financial credit of the
government is of some importance.
"We trust they will seriously take hold of the work and put new
vigor into the national finances." (7)
1657 - L. Apr. 12; ed: 2/1 - The work of popularizing the national debt
is being renewed with great success in the sale of ten 40's. This
loan is being taken up at the rate of over a million a day.
"We urgently commend this new loan to the people of Ohio." (7)
1658 - L. May 2; ed:4/2 - "Ten-forty" bonds are being advertised. No
more desirable investment can be made at the present time than these
bonds. The whole nation is pledged to the payment of these bonds. The
government debt is one-fourth of that of Great Britain at the close of
her great war in 1816, in proportion to the properties of the two
countries. "When the "Ten-forty" bonds are due, with our present ratio
of increase in national wealth, double our pres?nt national debt would
not be a charge of five percent on the property of the country. "We
therefore earnestly commend to all our readers this new popular loan
of which but 200 millions are to be taken. This is a patriotic way
to serve your country." (4)
1659 - L. May 17; ed: 2/1 - The public debt of the country is
$1,730,870, 140.83. Whether the national debt can be paid is to be
considered in the light of the experience passed through by European
countries.
Mr. Stebbins of New York, in a speech on national finance, took
the ratio of increase in the value of the property of the entire Union,
excluding the assessed value of the slaves from 1850 to 1860, and
calculated that in 1870 we shall have 35 billions of national wealth,
and in 1880, 80 billions.
"The danger is not in our ability; it lies in the partisan reck-
lessness which counts national integrity and honor as a small thing,

1660 - L June 25:4/2 - The nineteen-40 bonds are still before the pub-
lic and over $70,000,000 have been taken.
1661 -- L July 1; ed:2/1 - Reports are that Mr. Chase resigned because
Congress refused the necessary funds to carry on government affairs.
It is to be hoped that enough money can be raised through taxation
for necessary expenditures, and that Chase will withdraw his resigna-
tion. - - - . . . . .
1662 - L July 2; ed:2/2 - The first result of Secretary Chase's res-
ignation was to produce unsettled financial feeling. Increased gold
and produce indicates the markets are affected. Senator Fessenden -
succeeds Chase, and enjoys the reputation of financial ability which
will do a great deal to restore public faith. Congress and the coun-
try should give Fessenden undivided support. - -
1663 - H July 5; ed:4/1 - Mr. Fessenden as chairman of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, has had abundant experience, and has proved himself
to be "a thoroughly worthy and competent man." • * -
1664 - L July 4; ed: 1/2,2 - William Pitt Fessenden, long a political
figure, now our new financier, has courage and a good mind. He favors
extensive taxation because people prefer it to paying higher prices.

1665 - L July 13:2/4 - Secretary Fessenden's appeal for a loan to con-
tinue the war and to avoid having our finance involved, should be ap-
proved by the people of the nation. If people refuse to loan the
government their money, it must issue currency which will depreciate
in proportion to the amount issued. -
"Resolve to do a patriot's part by contracting your business opera-
tions, collecting your dues, and lending every possible dollar to
your country." -
1666 - L July 15; ed: 2/1 - Bankers in New York city seem to favor Sec-
retary Fessenden's new financial policy, which will probably be a
lcan of $50,000,000 or $75,000,000. "In whatever policy he adopts, it
is the duty of all men to give him their support, financial and moral."
1667 - L. July 27; ed:2/1 - Secretary Fessenden proposes a new loan
of two hundred million in treasury notes, to be issued in denominations
from $50 to $5000, and in blanks or payable to order, as may be ordered
by the subscriber, and to bear interest, which will be more valuable
than greenbacks. . . . . . .

"It is the duty of all citizens to take an interest in this new loan.
There can be no better investment of money than an investment which,
while yielding a liberal profit to the holder, enables the government to
meet its expenses and reduces the price of all the necessaries of life."
(9)
1668 - L. July 29; ed:2/2 - The new loan for $200,000,000 called by
Secretary Fessenden, is one of great importance and should be supported
by the people if the war is to be carried to a triumphant success. If
people will support the government, prices of articles may be reduced,
the value of government bonds increased, and the finances of the
nation be placed on a basis as sound as any in the world.
"If peace shall come within the coming year, as we ardently hope,
these bonds will be worth their full face in gold...." (9)
1669 - L Aug. 6: ed:2/2 - "Men should remember that Capital owes a
duty to the nation, and those who have money in banks or speculation,
and are unwill ing to lend of their means to the government in this
hour of trial, should remember, that in case of a failure of government
to sustain finances, Bankruptcy is declared, and they will be the heavy
sufferers." (5)
1670 - L. Aug. 9; ed: 2/1 - The hope and future of the country depends
upon the efforts of the people to lend to the government every cent of
money they can spare, however small the amount.
"The loyal people must feel that the responsibility lies with them.
Copperheads as a rule, are ready to embarrass the Treasury even unto
bankruptcy." (5)
1671 - L. Sept. 12; ed:2/2 - The eage raess with which Europeans are
buying federal bonds seems to be upsetting the Rebels, who have built
up hopes of our Financial failure.
"The world is beginning to realize that there is a permanency to the
Union and that the ability of this nation to pay a debt is unequaled by
any nation on the globe." (4)
1672 - L. Sept. 30; ed: 2/1 - Rapid decline in gold has stimulated purchase
of government bonds. "If you are looking for a good investment, there
is none better than U. S. Bonds. If you wish the speedy overthrow of
the rebellion, strengthen your Government with the money necessary to
give incessant vigor to its financial interests." (3)
1673 - L. Oct. 29; ed:2/2 - The Rebels are so anxious about our finan-
cial stability that European capitalists have been warned against in-
vesting in our bonds.
"This, in the face of our resources, is the most ridiculous perform-
ance that has yet taken place in Richmond. The resources of Pennsyl-
vania alone are worth more than all England." (2)

1674 - L Nov. 18; ed: 2/1 - A correspondent of the London TIMES thinks
that the Germans are unwise to invest their money in our government
bonds. "The truth is, however, the Germans are wiser than the John
Bulls. The stubborn Englishman is jealous of the good fortune of his
German neighbors who are buying six percent gold bearing bonds for
just half price, realizing as much as twelve percent on the dollar.
The Germans are wise just as our own people are." (4)

1675 - L. Jan. 20:2/1 - The Democrats have been taken somewhat aback by
the way the Union press has demanded strict a countability in every
department of national affairs. At the beginning of the war the great
urgency for the immediate formation and equipment of a grand army
made it possible for men to plunder the treasury. -
"Let our senators and representatives in Congress establish inquis-
itorial committees, who shall ferret out all scoundrel isn', and thus
give new honor and strength to the General Government." (9)
1676 - L. Jan. 20; ed:2/3 - Davis of Kentucky is below medium height,
70 years of age, his voice is harsh, and his physical powers are fail-
ing. He is prone to similes. He professes to be a Union man in favor
of putting down the Rebellion by force of arms. "Like a political
character portrayed in one of Dickens' works, he believes in opposing
everything just for the sake of belonging to the opposition side." (4)
1677 - L Jan. 28; ed: 2/2, 3 - In his speech to the members of the Leg-
islature at Anrapolis, the Hon. Mortgomery Blair touched on the cause
of the Rebellion and supported the President's plan of pacification.
He said that the Democratic party of the North was seduced into coun- .
tenancing the measures of oligarchs preparatory to the war against the
Union. -
"When masters of millions of slaves have boldly proclaimed slavery
as the last basis of government, and founded it on a military despotism
they have set up, what friend of the Union can hesitate to strike
down that system?" (35)
1678 - L. Feb. 1; ed: 2/2 - The resolution to expel Garrett Davis, the
ancient "Copperhead dawdler," from the U. S. Senate, has been with-
drawn. - --
"It is to be presumed that he will be a little more careful of his
language in the future." - (2)
1679 - L. Feb. 1; ed: 2/3 - Wendell Phillips has been denouncing Presi-
dent Lincoln, and calling on the people to make Chase president. He
thinks that the war should not be closed until slavery is extirpated.

"He will come to be called a conservative by-and-by, if he is not
careful - and then where will he go when he dies." (3)
1680 - L. Feb. 11; ed: 2/1 - One of the singular lines of attack which the
opposition have adopted is that of charging the government with an
unwillingness to prosecute the war with vigor and bring it to a speedy
close. "All the talk about the government desiring to delay the war,
is nothing but Fee, Faw, Fum of partisan clamor." (5)
1681 - L. Feb. 19; ed: 2/1, 2 - Popular sentiment in favor of the continu-
ance of Lincoln in office until the Rebellion has ended, has alarmed
political gamblers throughout the country. They have commenced the work
of vilifying the President and his administration.
"When the attempt is made to forestall the choice of the people it
is well that the people should be forewarned." (6)
1682 - L. Mar. 26; ed: 2/1 - Mr. Pendleton has introduced a bill to give
cabinet officers a seat in the House.
Difficulties might arise from giving cabinet members a place on the
floor to explain or defend their policy, since such an arrangement
would give free play to the inquisition of representatives. But after
giving all objections the importance due them, there are strong reasons
why Mr. Pendleton's bill should prevail.
Such a measure would reduce executive influence by making it more
directly accountable... every cabinet officer would be more careful
if his policy were subject to such inspection... it would be impossi-
ble to conceal fraud or treason, as was done during the reign of Mr.
Buchanan. (8)
1683 - L. Apr. 1; ed: 2/1 - The Pennsylvania "Copperheads" claim that if
McClellan, their candidate for president and an army man were elected,
he would be in favor of soldiers voting. The recent amendment passed
by the Pennsylvania legislature received one vote from the "Copper-
heads," while every Union member voted for it.
"This shows that these Pennsylvania Copperheads think more of
McClellan for being a Copperhead than for being a soldier." (3)
1684 - L Apr. 30; ed: 2/1 - There are rumors that Secretary Chase
intends leaving the cabinet on account of the recent re-assumption by
Gen. Frank Blair of his former position in the army. It is said that
the secretary of the trensury regards the action of President Lincoln
in the matter as an endorsement of General Blair's attacks upon the
management of the treasury department.
"We repeat that the good sense, patriotism, and self interest of
Secretary Chase will alike indicate to him the impropriety of resigning."

the Baltimore convention."
"Everything the Government can do the people may feel assured will -
be done to achieve the destruction of Lee's army." (3)
1686 - L May 26; ed: 2/1 - Democratic members of Congress are franking
newspapers to their constituency which contains the most infamous
abuse of the President. They want General Fremont for the next Pres-
ident.
This is a genial duty, so far as the Copperheads are concerned,
but General Fremont has too great a record in the same cause of freedom
to submit to such treatment." (2)
1687 - L May 28; ed:2/1 - The disgraceful attack of an Indiana "Copper-
head" upon Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, reminds us of the old congressional
days of bowie-knives and bludgeons. "It is highly probable that the
brutality of the chivalry will be transplanted entirely into the man-
ners and principles of such northern sympathizers as Voorhees." (3)
1688 - L June 21; ed: 2/2 - A New York paper wrote that the postmaster
general has instructed Postmaster Walburn of Philadelphia to use his
official influence to prevent the re-nomination of Judge Kelley.
"Mr. Blair (postinaster general) has the interest and the successful
administration of the Department too much at heart to allow himself
to turn it to a political machine." (4)

in August as a day of prayer.
"It is at all times proper that we should give thanks to God for his
mercies, and we should not forget the duty of confessing our sins and
humiliating ourselves before him." (2)
1690 - L. Aug. 4; ed:2/2 - Today, in conformity with the proclamation
of President Lincoln, the people of the United States are asked to
set aside the day for humility and prayer, to ask God if it be his will
that the Rebellion may be speedily suppressed, that the laws of the
United States may be established throughout the states, and that unity
and peace may be established throughout the nation.
"No better petition can be offered up. Let all the pecple assemble
this day to supplicate the blessings of Almighty God upon our distracted
country." (8)
1691 - L. Aug. 15; ed:2/2 - It is evident that the "Copperheads" have
exulted in the distraction of the Union party due to the "protest" writ-
ten by Senator Wade and Henry Winter Davis. It is reported that they
will use it as a campaign document which will be a good weapon unless
Unionists waive criticism, and unite upon the man who can give victory

"The first duty of every loyal man is to sustain the Government
in crushirg the rebellion, and establishing Liberty and Union through-
out our whole domain.
If defeat and betrayal of a great cause are to be the consequence
of manifestos and protests, we cannot understand how it is consistent
with the duty of loyal men and that of keeping the Government in loyal
hands, to inflame prejudices and passions of the people and thus lose
the very cause to be gained." (8)
1692 - L. Aug. 27; ed: 2/1 - The chief material Democratic editorials
for some time has been Lincoln's proclamation "To whom it may concern."
He has been denounced for expressing willingness to listen to terms
of peace which should embrace the territorial integrity and freedom
of the whole nation.
Why doesn't the PLAIN DEALER foam and rage about Jeff Davis' mani-
festo "To whom it may concern": "Say to Mr. Lincoln for me that I
shall at any time be pleased to receive proposals for peace on the basis
of our independence. It will be useless to approach me with any other."

1693 - L. Oct. 10; ed:2/1 - Reports circulated by "Copperheads" that
Lincoln has received his salary in gold are denied by L. E. Chittenden,
who held the position of registrar of the treasury. He receives his
salary in greenbacks as do other mortals in the North, and pays his
income tax with it. (2)
1694 - L. Oct. 27; ed: 2/1 - The "artful dodger," as Pendleton is some-
times called in Congress, says he has been misrepresented and that his
views toward the Union are the same as they've always been. Records
show this to be untrue. He did not regard the war as constitutional
and did not believe it should be suppressed.
"These are his views, and if he has been misrepresented, it is by
affirming that he did not believe the war Constitutional and that he was
in favor of suppressing the rebellion. Alas! for the Dodger. It is
too late now to dodge into the Vice Presidency." (18)
1695 - L. Dec. 14; ed:2/1 - James S. Speed, the new attorney general,
was active in the attempt to abolish slavery in Kentucky in 1892. He
freed his own slaves about three years ago. He is a native of Louis-

The mails between Cincinnati and Chicago are to be carried by the

These changes indicate the determination of the Postmaster General
to give the very best postal service possible to the public. He has

1710 - L. Jan. 4; ed: 1/1,2 - The ALABAMA was built and armed in England
and was manned by British men and officers, though owned by the Southern
slaveholders. - - - - -
"They attacked only unarmed and defenseless merchantmen, many of
them being loaded with grain and food for England. Fate seems to have
decreed that 'Curses come home to roost, ' since at the time a serious
food shortage was apparent in England." - (5)
L Feb. 22; ed: 2/3 - See Foreign Relations
1711 - L. Mar. 21; ed:2/1 - The English ministry, due to its ownership
of the ALABAMA and other private ships which ravaged the commerce of
the United States, is now anxious because of its position. Shaw Lafevre
censures the British goverment by comparing England to the lion, in
the fable "Lion and the Gnat." - - - - - -
"To save the British lion from worse injuries hereafter, than those
inflicted in our case, there is no method so certain as that suggested
by Shaw Lafevre." - (6)
1712 - L June 2; ed:2/2 - Ships built in English ports have been prow-
ling about the seas, plundering merchant vessels of friendly powers.
"Two years of successful piracy by the rebel pirates have at last
brought English merchants to their senses. They see that the effect of
a foreign war will be to transfer the carrying trade of the world to
other vessels than those of Great Britain." (13)
1713 - L. July 7; ed: 2/1,2 - The sinking of the pirate ship, ALABAMA by
the KEASARGE under Commander Winslow was great news for our navy. The
ALABAMA, with other piratical craft, has been a constant menace to the
naval department. "Commander Winslow deserves the promotion the govern-
ment plans to confer upon him." - - (8)
1714 - L July 9; ed:2/1 - Great loss has been felt by American shipping
due to Rebel pirates who have wrought such havoc that shippers no longer
use American bottoms. IIundreds of vessels are rotting at the wharves
in New York and the East Indies. "It is very mortifying to any man
who takes pride in the extent and glory of American commerce, to reflect
that a half dozen pirates, fitted out in English ports should be able
to inflict so heavy losses on our shipping." (6)
1715 - L. July 9; ed:2/3 - Another pirate ship, the FLORIDA, makes its
appearance on the coast and destroys five Armerican ships within a half-
day's sailing from our navy yards.
"If she does not share the fate of the ALABAMA, the discredit will
be mortifying. It is time that our sexagenarian secretary of the navy
should thoroughly wake up." (2)

fight between the KEARSARGE and the ALABAMA, as evidenced from an
article by the Duke of Somerset.

is the KEARSARGE." (3)
1717 - L Nov. 21; ed: 2/1 - The capture of the FLORIDA in a Prazilian
port has caused much comment in Europe. Their anxiety arises from
the fact that she is a pirate ship, an English-built vessel, manned
by Englishmen, and England can be held responsible for any damage done
by her. "If the Brazilian government demands her surrender, her
depredations on American commerce will only increase the account to
be settled against the government that first allowed her to go forth." (3)

calculates it will be $4,000,000,000 at the close of the war.

to offer our public domain in free homesteads to the farmers of Europe
and of America." (8)

road between New York and Cleveland will run without change of cars from
IIQW Oſ), (2)
1739 - L Dec. 8; ed: 2/2 - "The large number of accidents which have oc-
curred lately, both East and West, have caused considerable comment on
the defects of American railways."
One critic says: "The chief defects of many railways is insufficient
ballasting of the road. Another defect is the poor, cheap iron purchased
by some roads. The method of fastening rails to the sleepers is
often defective, spikes becoming loose and often can be pulled out with
the fingers. Bolts or wood screws should be used. India rubber springs
on freight cars are considered dangerous because of the hammering they
produce, but hammering would be greatly reduced by good springs that
would ease the weight from a sudden blow or jolt. The mean and illegal
spirit prevents many companies from first making good roads, and then
keeping their bad ones in repair." (10)
1740 - H Dec. 27; ed: 2/3 - "The responsibility resting, at all times,
upon railroad managers is neither light nor enviable; at this time such
responsibility is ponderous. Our roads are reaching the end of their
first life; most of them were not substantially built and hence have
early come to decreptitude. These evils could easily be remedied were
it not the misfortune of the colupanies, just now, to have thrown upon
their tracks an amount of business they are inadequate, properly and
safely, to carry. Cold weather, too, ... aggravates terribly the dangers
of rail transit." (11)

belongs to Congress and not to the President, although we have regarded
him fully authorized to provide for restoration to the Union of such
States as have come under our military sway. We are in favor of Peace
and the restoration of the Union. Let the law of re-admission be de-
termined when reconstruction becomes possible and necessary." (12)

RECONSTRUCTION (Cont'd)
1779 - L. Sept. 28:2/1 - Seperate state action is getting to be a favor-
ite doctrine in many quarters of the South, and if a state treats for
peace as a sovereign state she withdraws from the Confederacy. Rebel
leaders who still cherish hope of success through the overthrow of the
present administration look with alarm upon the movement calculated to
work their speedy overthrow which is now started.
"It cannot be doubted that if there be such a movement in the State
of Georgia, sustained by men of positions and numbers who wish to bring
back Georgia to her allegiance, that a magnanimous course will be adopted
by the Government of the United States in order to win her away from
the wicked rebellion.
"If now she will see fit, having repented of her sins and lamented
her wicked folly, to return to her allegiance, she can have peace. The
Government will put no obstructions in the way of an immediate return.
Georgia cuts the Confederacy in twain and makes it impossible for a re-
construction of the remaining fragments." (11)
1780 - L. Sept. 29; ed:2/2 - "All that is necessary to peace, is that
the Rebels shall render unconditional obedience to the laws of the Con-
stitution. They must abide the consequences the war has brought upon
them, and not expect to be indemnified for any losses brought upon them-
sleves by the Rebellion." (3)
1781 - L Nov. 16; ed: 2/2 - The only way the tendencies of the people
will be directed toward loyalty to the government is by destroying the
power of the institution cf slavery and giving to free labor the power
of the slave states.
"To reconstruct Southern society on the basis of Northern sco iety is
the only guarantee of future peace to the country after the suppression
of the rebellion.
"We may, therefore, rejoice in the many indications of progress in
that direction. An entire Republican form of Government must prevail
throughout the land, or the South can cmly be held in subjection by a
central military despotism, from which every loyal, liberty-loving
American must shrink with fearful apprehensions." (9)

her. Captain Turner is to be master. . (2)
1836 - L Apr. 1:4/6 - Messrs. Quayle and Martin launched a bark at their
yards yesterday afternoon for Cunningham, Shaw, and Company of Liverpool.
The ship was designed to form one of the lines operated by this firm be-
tween Liverpool and the Great Lakes. She is called the THERMUTIS, ard
though not of the largest size, is one of the staunchest vessels ever
turned out by our builders. She will be wire-rigged. As soon as com-
pleted she will clear for Liverpool, where she will receive her register
and commission, preparatory to taking her place in the line.
We believe this vessel is the first launched from a western shipyard
for a foreign account, and we feel proud to be able to claim this distinc-
tion for our enterprising shipbuilders. -
The THERMUTIS is 142 feet long over-all, with a keel length of 137 feet.
Her beam is 26 feet, her hold, 12-1/2 feet, and burthen, 420 tons.
The business of our shipbuilders this season has been large, and the
vessels contracted for of the best class, continued proof of the high
estimate in which our builders are held.
Peck, and Masters are now building three propellers for Dean Richmond
to run in connection with the New York Central railroad. They will be
ready for the spring trade. . . . . -
' ' ' The DEAN RICHMOND, one of the finest ships of her kind on the Great
Lakes, was recently launched for N. C. and II. J. and II. J. Winslow by
Quayle and Martin and is now receiving her boilers at the Cuyahoga works.
She will see service in the Buffalo-Chicago line. This firm is also en-
gaged in building a propeller for Capt. Edward Turner.
Loffrimier has nearly completed a fine propeller for Robert Hanra and
Company, to run in the Lake Superior line.
Presley and Stevens bave rebuilt the Northern Transportation co's pro-
peller YOUNG AMERICA, adding several feet to her length, and making other
important improvements. - -
Several tugs are being constructed for various parties, and T. W.
Kennard of the Atlantic and Great Western railroad is having a magnifi-
cent steel yacht built by Peck and Masters. (7)

With the ATLANTIC and the PACIFIC, the new boat will be used in the
Buffalo and Cleveland daily service. (3)
1840 - L. May 24:4/5 - The chief interest in navigation has been trans-
ferred from the shipyards to the harbor, most of the new vessels having
been launched.
A splendid yacht for T. W. Kennard, Esq., is being built by Peck and
Masters, and a propeller called IRONSIDES is being built by Quayle and
Martin. The Kennard yacht is 44 feet long. Her beam is 25 feet, the
depth of the hold, 14 feet and the tonnage, 500 tons. She is really a
small ocean steamer built for swiftness of sailing and comfort of pas-
sengers. Mr. Kennard has given orders that the boat shall be built of
western material and by western labor. Her furniture will be costly and
luxurious. At the end of the season the boat will be taken to New York
in readiness for a trip to England at the beginning of the next season.
The dimensions of the propeller IRONSIDES are as follows: Length, 233
feet; beam, 31 feet, and depth of hold, 13-1/2 feet. She is being built for
Lake Superior passenger trade. Her engines, two low pressure cylinders,
34 by 46 inches, are from the Cuyahoga works. She will have three foot

nine feet aft and four feet eight inches forward. There are spacious
pantry and cook rooms, and a smoking room with facilities for washing.
The total number of engines is five. The main engines are of the con-
densing type, with a 44-inch bore and a 34-inch stroke. There are two
separate boilers and smoke stacks. The design of the entire machinery is
simple, yet evinces a correctness of proportion, a regard for taste, and
an arrangement of detail complimentary to her designer, J. F. Holloway,
and the builder, the Cuyahoga works.

The hoisting engines are 12 by 12, high pressure. These are connect-
ed with a line of shafting, running the entire length of the boat, and
are used for discharging the cargo as well as working extra bilge pumps
in case of necessity. The boºt is also supplied with a steam duplex
Westinghouse pump, used for filling the boilers in port, or when the main
engines are stopped, and also, by means of pipe and hose, to throw water
on all parts of the boat in case of fire. -
"Probably no boat yet built is so well provided against any accident
from leakage or fire as this one is."
Painting of the boat was done most excellently by R. L. Willard. The

1961 - L. Jan. 1; ed: 2/2 - President Lincoln shows wisdom in making haste
slowly. Every step he has taken is well considered. Freedom in its
full measure cannot be transplanted to southern soil in a single day.
Time should be allowed for great changes to be safely and permanently
accomplished. (2)
1962 - L. Feb. 6; ed: 2/1 - Walled towns, arsenals, cattle, railroads,
cities, and broadacres are sources of power to a nation.
"If these are fruits of crime instead of honest industry, then it is
the duty and province of the legislature to ignore the sources of such
material growth. If a nation is built upon the unpaid labors of a weak-
er race, this certainly is not a glory to any nation." (4)
1963 - L. Feb. 6; ed: 2/2 - The late James B. Clay boasted of the attach-
ment and devotion of his slaves. To prove this, he told his old house
slave, Tom, that he might have his freedom. Tom, at his unexpected lib-
eration, was joyful and said he would leave.
"Of course Tom was never freed, but Clay thenceforth was less assured
of his servants' affection for their slave-life." (6)
1964 - H Feb. 23; ed: 1/2, 3 - "The way is open, beyond blocking up by
politicians of any party, for the complete downfall of Slavery. It is
the natural result of the slaveholders' rebellion, and in the South as
well as in the North, the feeling is becoming universal that both the
political and physical power of Slavery are over in the United States."
(16)
1965 - L. Mar. 8:4/3, 4 - In a speech at the Sanitary fair, Miss Dickinson
referred to a story of the black man at Rodmans Point, who, when a boat
was stuck fast and swept by Rebel bullets, coolly got up and pushed it
off, remarking: "Somebody must die to get out of this and it might as
well be I." Above all groans, l;atred and sighs comes the voice of a
down-trodden people saying: "Somebody must die to get us out of this
and it might as well be we."
When she compared the Breckenridge Democrats in New York as fit
associates for robbers in the South, several people got up and walked
out, whereupon the speaker remarked; "Thats right, run away from the
truth you can't stand." (43)
1966 - L. May 19; ed: 2/2 - The rooms of the Women's league in New York
City are being flooded by emancipation petitions. "The work should be

Emancipation." (1)

says: That Cairo, where she landed, is the stopping place for the refugees,
white and black, that flee from the terrible oppressions of the Confed-
erates. She found groups of these ill-fated people, lying, sitting, and
standing in an almost unimaginable condition of wretchedness and poverty,
squalid, filthy, pale, haggard with hurger, fever and toil. She says:
"If there is any one who has enlisted in the work of emancipation, that
has felt like turning back, let me beseech them to persevere, if not for
the sake of the Negro, for the sake of the white men and women whose hu-
manity is crushed, almost into brutishness, by this unknown monster,
slavery." (18)
1969 - L. June 20; ed:2/2 - Both houses of Congress passed the bill repeal-

South never denied it. He also claims that the efforts made by the free
states to abolish slavery were antagonistic.
He also declares that he has been in favor of modifying the fugitive
slave law, but "judging from his editorial opinions nowadays, it cer-
tainly does not look much like it." (4)

has done a very cruel, impolitic and unconstitutional act.... The South,
driven to the verge of Union, ... wooed by the dulcet assurances of demo-
cratic love, ... were about to fling themselves into the loving embraces
of their Northern friends.
"According to the New York WORLD... Mr. Lincoln could have offered to
these Southern Lords no greater insult than to demand an oath of alle-
giance to the proclamation of emancipation. 'If instead of this he had
made t l;em offers which the world would have regarded as just and liberal,
the bottom of Meminger's financial bucket would have been knocked out....'
"There may be politicians ready to hob-nob with Jeff Davis in the

of a case in Hilton Head, S. C., where a colored man whipped his wife
and son until the son died. He says: "The colored man had been a slave
driver among the rice fields in Georgia for a number of years. He had
no opportunity to indulge in his propensities for a long time, and I
suppose it was as much a gratification to him to whip that boy to death
as it is for an old toper to take a drink. I take it this is one of the
outcroppings of the institution (we see a great many) and shows the deep,

they would rise to the dignity of their intellects, and revolutionize

"This young man... evidently has an exalted estimate of manhood.
"The dignity of his intellect is reached only in the great work of

The spiritualists of Chicago will hold a national convention Aug. 9.

"One would think Chicago lived over a swamp of the most awful pu-
trefaction, and that the people were everlastingly breaking through the
thin surface into the miry depths below. The long-haired, the bloomered

but after receiving sufficient proof, they knew he spoke the truth.
"It is to be hoped that this revelation will open the eyes of the

L May 18; ed: 2/1 - See Women
2037 - L. May 28; ed: 2/1 - Authorities think that Canada should be
dealt with as other foreign nations are treated; that she should not be
favored by any treaty. - - -
"The leaven of Old England is at work in their midst, and if the
Reciprocity treaty bestows special favors upon them it should be abro-
gated." (3)
2038 - L July 16:2/2 - Wilkes, editor of THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES says,
"The Jews from England, and the continent, and agents of firms such as
Rothschilds, are jealous of the financial condition of the United States,
and are trying to ruin currency and promote disaffection among the
people, by advancing prices of all commodities."
"The remedy proposed by Wilkes, to pass a Non-Intercourse Act, is a
bold one, and may yet be a popular one, and we regard it as embodying
much good and potent logic." (6)
2039 - L Dec. 10; ed: 2/2 - The Board of Trade at Detroit has been dis-
cussing the reciprocity treaty and agrees that a commission is needed
to revise it.
"The tendency of civilization is undoubtedly toward unrestricted . . .
commercial intercourse between different nations, but as matters now
stand, there is need of modification in the Reciprocity Treaty to en-
able American Manufacturers to compete with Canadian products." (5)
TAXATION &amp; TAXES
2040 - L. Jan. 22; ed: 2/1 - Congress and the people are aware of the
necessity for renewed taxation. The last taxation imposed by Congress
yielded but $100,000,000 instead of $150,000,000. If the states were asked
to collect their own taxes for the general government, it would save
much expense. All articles taxed should be taxed before reaching the
consumer's hands. (9)
2041 - L. Jan. 27:4/4 - The following resolution presented by Mr. Payne
was adopted: That the city attorney with the chairman of the committee
of finance, take measures that will insure legislation at Columbus in-
creasing the amount of taxes for general municipal purposes, enabling

tion of it. (1)

TAXATION &amp; TAXES (Cont'd)
2043 - L Apr. 15:4/3 - John E. Hurlbut, Esq., U. S. Assessor for this
district, states that profits realized from the sale of stocks are tax-
able as income; that profits on stock, real estate, etc., purchased pre-
vious to the passage of the excise law, and sold subsequent to its pass-
age, are taxable as income. For example: Wilson sold 15 acres for
$15,000 having bought them in 1844 for $900. Allowing $2,700 for inter-
est, the total profit would be $11,400. This would be considered as
income for 1863 and taxed as such. (16)
2045 - L. May 25:4/5 - The following ordinance was passed by the city
council: To levy and assess a special tax on Eagle st. (1)
2046 - L. May 25:4/5 - The following ordinance was passed by the city coun-
cil: To levy and assess a special iax upon Prospect st. (1)
2047 - L. July 6; ed: 2/1 - It is very necessary that Congress pass a tax
bill. Taxation, being new to the people, will be hard to be borne, es-
pecially by the poor, but a direct taxation, if inaugurated, will mean
that rich and poor will pay taxes in proportion to their incomes.
"Opposition to a tax bill is simply conspiracy against the life of
the nation." (9)
2048 - L. Sept. 23; ed: 2/1 - Some seem to think that it would be a good
idea to levy a tax of five cents a pound on cotton to pay a debt of
$2,000,000,000 owed by the South.
"This would be a fine scheme for the Southern Confederacy. After hav-
ing involved the nation in a great war, they now want the people of the
North to help them pay the price of their guilt. The reverse of this
would be justice." (6)
2049 - L. Dec. 2; ed:2/3 - It is rumored that a tax is to be imposed on
all sales. The total of our commerce for 1860 was $7,000,000,000. The
present inflation of prices would make it $12,000,000,000. Estimating
all products that pass from producer to consumer, we should have $36,000,
000,000 of sales.
"Here is an easy method of raising an immense sum of money. With cer-
tain limitations and restrictions, this plan would, in connection with
the Internal Revenue system, raise enough to pay for the war." (3)
2050 - L Dec. 6; ed:2/2 - Leading financiers of the country, men in
authority at Washington, and people in general, are becoming convinced
that the expenses of the war should be paid by a system of taxation,
instead of by loans mortgaging future generations.
"The taxation that may be imposed on the people can be easily endured
in vicw of the fact that the value of currency must be greatly improved.
The tax is inefficient in its operation because officers who are supposed
to assess and collect it, many times fail to do so.

cels himself in the fidelity of conception and spiritedness of rendition.

night. (3)
2127 - L Nov. 30:4/3 - The sensational drama, WAITING FOR THE WERDICT,
was presented to the largest audience of the season last night. This play
has recently had a successful run in the east. It is domestic in character
and appeals to those deep quiet sympathies which are common to all. The
play is full of startling incidents; the elements are so varied that nothing
in the way of stimulus is wanting. In the way of criticism, some things
foreign and unnecessary were added which would have been better left out.
The rendition was admirable, and Mr. Buchanan as the old farmer was excellent
throughout. Virginia Buchanan as the wife of the innocent convict failed
at times to put depth and feeling in her expression. The play, all in all,
was admirably delivered. (8)
2128 - L. Dec. 21:4/3 - The great spectacular drama, ALADDIN, produced
for the first time in many years at the Academy of Music, was very success-
ful. The audience was more enthusiastic over it than a Clevelard audience
has ever been over any other play. Mr. Ellsler as the dumb slave, "Kasrac,"
exhibited pantomimic power that might be ranked in the first order of comedy
acting. The piece contains the unique and original Chinese umbrella dance.

2129 - H Dec. 27:3/2 - The Academy of Music was filled yesterday with ladies
and children who were delighted with the presentation of ALADDIN. (2)

2214 - L Aug. 10; ed:2/2 - Traveling about for rest and relaxation is fast
becoming a habit, as is evidenced by the crowded condition of trains.
Whole families are off for the sea shore, mountains, watering places, or
some quiet place in the country "where sin-ple manners and customs have
not yielded to artificial habits of the day, and where respite may be had
from too fierce exhilaration of modern civilization."
There is, generally, on the part of Americans, an amount of silence and
isolation indulged in, in consequence of a false pride or snobbish aris-
tocracy, and people often ride hundreds of miles without making an
acquaintance, and thereby miss, oft-times, delightful companionship that
would be a profit and a pleasure.
"Good humor and a bright smile go far to make the world delight in you,
and a contented face wins its way every where." (17)

wide. It is divided by a massive pier made of stone masonry. The pier
is 14 feet high, four feet thick at the base, and 32 inches at the top.
The sides of the tunnel are ten feet thick and the same height as the pier.
Two arches made of brick span the track on each side of the pier.
The work is under the general supervision of A. A. Wright, Esq. (10)

2256 - L Nov. 12:4/3 - The new fruit house on Kinsman st. owned by Nyce,
Shirk and Co. and invented by Nyce is 83 feet in length and 45 feet wide.
It consists of upper and lower compartments: The upper one contains ice
and is separated from the lower compartment by a floor of galvanized
iron. The sides are made of sheet iron, three and one-half feet apart;
the intervening space is filled with sawdust and short shavings. The
floor is made of galvanized iron and below this there is a layer of coal-
tar and pitch, spread one-half inch thick on the ground to prevent mois-
ture. Two wind wheels are on top of the bui iding, geared to fans in the
preserving apartment. Chloride of calcium, used to absorb vapors from
the air, is spread in a basin seven feet wide. The temperature of this
building is a little below 34 degrees and does not vary one degree from . "
April to October. The condensed water runs out through tubes from the
floor at the rear end of the building and is dried in large pans of shect
iron over the furnace. (21)

2257 - L. May 18; ed: 2/1 - One of the best established truths of history
is that the intellect of a nation is largely quickened both during and
after a great war.
"All the avenues of trade and business have felt the stimulating
power of the inventive genius of our people during the past three years,
and when once the ordeal is over, we shall be a nation of more unbound-
ed prosperity and resources than any other people on the earth." (4)

2258 - L. Jan. 6; ed: 2/1 - "The American people have a decided weakness
for prophecy. This weakness has been alarmingly developed since the
beginning of the war. We have, so far as we know, no prominent public
man who has not indulged in vaticinations. Mr. Seward is a remarkable
example. We have styled it a 'weakness for prophecy"; certainly there
are no utterances of Mr. Seward's so weak as his sixty-day and ninety-
day prognostications of thirty months ago.
"No doubt the Confederacy has received some staggering blows in the
campaign just closed, but that there is any evidence that its strength
and vigor are exhausted, we deny.
"We are confident that the war can be ended in one more campaign, but
not by starvation, not by a degenerated currency, not by an "amnesty," -
but by the armies of Meade and Foster, Grant and Banks. We should not be
thus pointed in our strictures, did we not see danger to the Republic in
the delusive prophecies just now so common. There is no other way but to
cease prognosticating; fill the regiments and hurl them once more upon
the foe." (18)

2259 - L Feb. 6; ed: 2/1 - Further fighting is necessary. The conscrip-
tion bill has passed, meaning that whites between the ages of 18 and 55
are to be put in the army. The Rebels have weakened and we have wrested
a great amount of their territory, but they can rally again.
"Let us remember that notwithstanding the infatuation of the Rebel
leaders and their distress on every hand they may, by concentrating their
shattered columns, deal ponderous blows upon the fair fabric of the
Republic." (12)
2260 - L. Feb. 12; ed:2/2 - Legoyt, chief of the statistical bureau of
the French ministry of agriculture, commerce, and public works, reports
on the strength of the armies of Europe. The report says: "In a time
of profound peace this strength is 3,875,847 men, nearly equal to the
whole population of the state of New York." Legoyt indulges in reflec-
tion as to the "disarming of one-half" of each army. 1,907,924 men,
between the ages of 20 and 35, are restored to labors of peace, and at
once a saving of $32,000,000 is affected. This amount can be used to
extend railroads, establish more schools, or reduce taxes. This would
mean a great deal to the people of Europe. Two million men would be re-
stored to the arts of peace and rates of labor would be reduced. It
would preserve family bonds, broken because of absence.
"It is to prevent just such a condition as this, that the American
people have been plunged into this bloody war....
"The southern slave lords would like to imitate the 'baker's dozen'
plan by which Europe is governed. This vast system by which men are
dragooned into submission, will receive its death blow in the triumph of
our arms." (15)
2261 - L. Feb. 13; ed:2/1, 2 - The Rebels are making preparations for the
spring campaign. Literally they are to stake the last man and the last
dollar. Jeff Davis' decisions are made at the behest of his armies.
"Let the north rise in its might once more. Let Congress pass a bill
to fill our armies immediately." (7)
2262 - L. Feb. 15; ed:2/1 - Our armies are about to enter upon a grand
campaign which promises to penetrate the very core of the Rebellion.
Grant, Thomas, Meade, and others are pushing forward their steady veter-
ans and threaten to drive this Rebellion to the limits of South Carolina.
"If the last thundering at the gates is to be done here, it will only
be a righteous retribution visited upon a fearfully guilty people." (9)
2263 - L. Mar. 9; ed:2/2 - Jeff Davis is convinced that his hold on
Virginia cannot endure and he has determined to occupy all the leading
places in North Carolina.
"We trust no lack of vigilance will be exhibited in North Carolina,
since it is important to hold our position there." - (3)

2264 - L. Mar. 30; ed:2/2 - The Rebel press is industriously discussing
the coming spring campaign and is drawing delusive pictures of the con-
ditions and spirit of the North. -
. . . . "Another and a better class of men from the North and from Europe,
will fill up the South and if several hundred thousand rebels will be
exterminated the world will be better off in the new population which
will take their place." (12)
2265 - L Apr. 18; ed: 2/1 - Now that the Rebels have given up hope, they
give themselves up to atrocious and inhuman crimes at . Fort Pillow.
"It will take some rerve to execute 400 rebel soldiers, but if the
government stands faithful in its pledge to the colored soldiers, it
cannot escape the responsibility." (7)
2266 - L. Apr. 21; ed:2/2 - President Lincoln pledges the protection of
the government to all Negro soldiers, in a speech at Baltimore.
"These words of the President will find a hearly response in the
hearts of the people, and this public pledge of the power of the nation
will only add new lustre to a name already glorious in the annals of -
American history." - (3)
2267 - L Apr. 27; ed: 2/1 - May, June, and July are to test the strength
of the Rebellion and determine whether the Union shall triumph over the
conspirators against the life of the Republic. What is wanted is the
concentration of every available man against the stronghold of treason.
"Something should be done, but by all means, let the men of business

"We trust the affair on the Red river is the last remnant of the
'scatteration' policy." (3)
2269 - L. May 4; ed:2/1 - The people watch and pray, and all mankind specu-
lates upon the impending military struggles.

which there is no recovery. A victory to the cause of 'liberty and Union'
will be attended with the most splendid results." (12)
2270 - L. May 7; ed: 2/1 - For every black soldier killed in violation of
the laws, a Rebel soldier shall be executed. "This is a statement in
good plain English. There is no avoiding the issue made. Justice asks
for no sentimental whining or whimpering about the cruelty of retalia-
tion." (14)

the history of all ages." (10)
L May 17; ed:2/2 - See Elections, Campaigns &amp; Candidates - United States
2272 - L May 20: ed: 2/1 - At the beginning of the Civil War, the North-
erners felt unduly sensitive to the opinions of European nations, be-
cause they wanted that solid growth of history which gives a permanent
character to a people. So reads Goldwin Smith's letter to a Whig mem-
ber of the Southern Independence association.
"But all this is changed by our Civil War. The American people have
compressed centuries of history into months. That immortal valor of our
soldiers which outshines the most splendid achievements of England's
armies, and which is known and honored throughout the world, has made
a history for the young republic." (16)
2273 - L. May 24; ed: 2/1 - The nation is pre-occupied with stirring
events and the great interests of society, such as temperance and re-
ligion, suffer by reason of the overwhelming issues of war.
"This is forcibly illustrated by the study of the jaded, over-anxious
faces of men who push their professional and financial enterprises with
remorseless energy and excitement, which are rapidly working the physi-
cal and mental ruin of their victims." (16)
2274 - L May 24; ed: 3/2 - When asked his views of the present military
situation, President Lincoln replied, "Well, sir, your question reminds
me of a little anecdote about the automaton chess player, which many
years ago astonished the world by its skill in that game. After a while
the automaton was challenged by a celebrated player, who to his great
chagrin was beaten twice by the machine. At the end of the second game,
the player...exclaimed in a very decided tone, 'There's a man in it.'
And this, sir, is just the secret of our present success."
"If this could be said of every pair of trousers north of the Mason

Fourth of July." (3)

"A stranger passing from Baltimore to Washington would not infer that a

coffee, and crackers, who ministered to each wounded man as he came
from the boat." - - (21)
2276 - L June 15; ed:2/1 - General Sherman orders the exclusion of news-
paper corresponder:ts from his lines.
"It is noticeable that our greatest and most successful commander,
Lieutenant General Grant, bas never had any difficulty or quarrel with
newspaper correspondents. He has always shown himself ready and willing
to extend to them all proper information and accommodation." (20)
2277 - L June 23; ed: 2/1 . There exists throughout Grant's army a belief
that our arms are yet to triumph. Soldiers coming home, however, do not
find that confidence.
"Let our whole people once feel as the soldiers feel, and there need
be no fear for the Republic." (9)
2278 - L July 2:2/3 - In a letter to the editor, a Mrs. Gage writes:
"I have been in Natchez one week and have made myself busy locking into
conditions of the Refugees and Freedman, (which is my mission) and sad,
sickening, and pitiful sights meet me at every turn."
Mrs. Gage describes the refugees as being in poor physical condition.
Scarcely a woman has shoes, many walking in intense heat carrying babies.
Husbands and brothers are hanged by Rebels; some are shot in defense
of their homes.
Natchez hospitals are in good condition. (16)
2279 - L. July 9; ed: 2/1 - Time is the chief essential in the ending of

"Emerging from a period of long and prosperous peace into a war whose
vastness and ferocity are unparalleled in the history of the world, it is *
not strange that the American people should sometimes hesitate to go
forward. Success or failure in the great work to which people once con-
secrated themselves, depend wholly upon our readiness to endure trials.
"Let the American people tolerate no idea of failure, shrink from no
sacrifices, and triumphant, glorious peace will result." (11)

2281 - L. July 19; ed: 2/1 - It is estimated that more than 500 Rebels
laid siege to Washington for two days and are on their way to Lynch-
burg, through the Shenandoah valley. They secured fresh horses, and
fresh beef for the army, "besides inevitable prestige from home and
Europe for having cut off the Capitol from the rest of mankind, which
serves to encourage and produce much hilarity in the rebel army." (6)
2282 - L July 29: 1/3 - In a letter to the editor, Harry D., Battery C,
1st. O. W. L. A., writes of the intense heat and says the earth is so
dry that pontooning is necessary to get inhabitants over seams and
chasms. He says the health of the army is very good despite hard work
and warm dry weather, and that supplies come in quantities which makes
them very happy. He remarks: "We owe much to the hundred-day men for
bringing about this condition of things. We will not call them the
'flower of the country, ' as they have been called by some papers, be-
cause it was a duty done but long deferred. May we soon see the end of
this war, and be on terms of peace with all the world." (12)
2283 - L July 30:2/1 - While soldiers are sweltering in the terrible
heat and giving their very life's blood for the cause of humanity,
others not so patriotic are hunting cooler places for relaxation, some
going to the lake region, others to the mountains and rural districts.
"The great North, overflowing with wealth and prosperity, may hurry
off to the mountains and lakes to spend the money with which the war has
enriched them, but never let them forget that all their peace, comfort,
and prosperity are due to the battle line of brave hearts that in
Wirginia, Louisiana, Georgia and other southern states are between them
and the foe that would ruthlessly destroy all this great wealth and pros-
perity of the North. What a contrast between the desolation of the
South and the prosperity of the North. May Peace soon come." (13)
2284 - L Aug. 2:2/3 - In a letter to the editor, E. H. E. says: Due to
the reports of Rebel raids, there is no excitement to speak of, consider-
ing the fact that from 30,000 to 50,000 Rebels have threatened invasion.
The case is quite the contrary and business is carried on unabated.
The fine appearance and good order of Washington is due to the energy
of the military department. Guards patrol the streets and allow no fast
riding or driving.
William Cushman, a Clevelander, was killed in the battle of Snicker's
Gap. Wa. (14)
2285 - L Aug. 13; ed: 2/1 - Anxious expectations of the people are often
disappointed by predictions of professional croakers, especially about

how many states have declared themselves against slavery since the be-
ginning of the civil war, they will see that the Rebellion will be
annihilated in another year.

"The immense work that has been accomplished is made more striking
if we ask ourselves, shall all this territory be surrendered and the
South be acknowledged? What party in power would think of giving up
all we have gained?
"The Croakers, who despair of the success of our cause, would do
well to stop and consider the important gains already made by the North." )
(14
2286 - L. Aug. 13; ed:2/2 - Difficulties in the way of restoring the
Union are over if we consider many things already accomplished. The
Mississippi river is in our control; the mountain range from Pennsylvania
to northern Georgia and Alabarua is in our possession, and government
scruples about Negro soldiers overcome. These successes plus other
accomplishments by the North, make success of the Union assured if the
people have courage to complete the great work.
"If we are to prove ourselves a great people, these consideration
are calculated to give us great hope and courage." (6)
2287 - L. Aug. 16; ed:2/1 - "Though war is a scourge of the most bitter
character, and though there follow in its train ten thousard evils and
vices, it yet has its influence for good, in moulding the spirit of a
great nation."
History shows that a nation is never the same after a great war.
People change souially and politically, and occupy different positions
toward other nations. War sometimes degrades or lowers haughty nations
to the level of inferior powers, and again it elevates to a lofty posi-
tion a small and gallant nation with resources of unexpected richness,
an example being our own country. One change is the interest shown by
European countries towards us. Before the revolution they scarcely gave
our republic a thought as to consulting the United States about making
changes in European affairs. Things are changed now, and hereafter.
"The views entertained by the Republic on 'balance of power' must be
entitled to great consideration."
Another change brought about by the war is the social change. There's
a more unequal distribution of property than has hitherto existed in
this country and there must, therefore, be such a change in the affairs
of the people as corresponds to this new financial condition.
Another result of the war will be the selection as candidates for
offices of military men who are accustomed to the stern government of the
army and will, therefore, modify the political status of the country.
"We are entering upon a new stage of being, and will not be the same
people hereafter, that we have been heretofore." (18)
2288 - L. Aug. 20; ed: 2/2 - For several weeks horses and cattle have been
taken from Canada to be shipped to Rebel states, but the dangers from
climate, food, and travel will undoubtedly be fatal to many; and, though
sailing under a neutral flag, these animals may be overhauled as contra-
band property,
"We shall see before many weeks what becomes of this Rebel venture."

ing to male the impression that the war was brought about by abolition-
ists, and inferring that Daniel Webster declared that "if abolitionists
get power in their hands, they will over-ride the constitution, change
and make laws to suit themselves, bankrupt the country, and deluge it
with blood."
"Webster made no such remarks, and to publish such a piece of lying
nonsense is a vile slander upon the memory of that great man."
Events that occurred before the inauguration of Lincoln show that
he war was started by Southern slave holders. Jeff Davis gave orders
to General Beaureguard to commence the war by firing on Fort Sumter, -
and then undertook to capture Washington. (17)
2290 - L. Sept. 6; ed: 2/1 - The success of General Sherman in the south-
west has done much to restore the faith of the people, and enable them
to see the future of the republic.
"From all sides we hear the people rallying with strong hearts to the
cause of Liberty and Union. Only keep the ball rolling and the last
relics of sneaking Democracy will be destroyed." (4)
2291 - L. Sept. 9; ed:2/1 - The Port of Wilmington, in North Carolina,
is the only port left for blockade runners, and through it the Rebel
credit and cotton loan is maintained in Europe.
"It is therefore the duty of the Government to turn the attention of
the Navy in that direction, and when it is taken, the Rebel credit will
be forever lost in Europe." (3)
2292 - L. Sept. 22:2/1 - After rumors of a year or two, we hear that
Rebels from Canada and Sandusky have made attempts to seize the steamer
MICH IGAN and ravage the commerce of the lakes.
"If there be any Democrats who doubted the tendency of teachings of
Democratic leaders, let them take warning from the example set by cer-
tain McClellan men in Sandusky." (3)
2293 - L. Sept. 23; ed: 2/1 - "There is no charge more frequently reiter-
atei with less show of reason than that which affixes the responsibility
of this devastating war upon the Union." In Stephens' address in 1860
before the Georgia legislature, he admitted that Lincoln's election was
not sufficient cause for Rebellion.
The leading traitors of the South had been trying to organize and
consummate secession as completely as possible before the inauguration
of the new President, and the Rebels would not have seceded if the
Republican party had agreed to throw open the territories to slavery,
which was simply asking the party to give up the principle on which it
had elected Lincoln.
"The respºnsibility of this cruel war must remain forever with the
South - on their heads must abide the consequences." (20)

the Public Square, Sept. 26, to celebrate the victories won by Sheridan tº
was attended by 20,000 people. Ward delegations were there in force, -
some bearing campaign mottoes. A salute was fired while the crowd was
gathering. Bonfires lighted the streets in honor of the occasion.
A beautiful display of fireworks preceded the speeches made by J. C.
Grannis, Esq., H. T. Oakley, and Dr. Robertson of Bedford. Albert T.
Slade also spoke at length, on victories the Union has won, and im-
plored the people to upho'd Union principles. The meeting was a grand
success, and its equal will not be seen here until Oct. 5. (39)
2295 - L. Oct. 22; ed: 2/1 - The New York HERALD warns officials of all

for this incendiary work. - - -
"Before the 9th of November an attempt of this kind will be made, and
it behooves all city authorities to be on guard." (3)
2296 - L Oct. 27; ed:2/2 - "Copperheads" are anxiously waiting for some
military disaster to befall our arms and are anxious to make out that
Sherman is in a bad way. The New York NEWS has been trying for a veek
to prove that disaster awaits our army in Georgia, and knows there is
no chance of success at the coming election unless it can make an im-
pression that disasters have befallen our army. "But victory perches on
all our banners and the Copperheads are doomed to disappointment." (3)
2297 - L. Oct. 31; ed:2/2 - A Richmond paper recently threatened the
burning of Northern cities in retaliation for the vigorous measures of
our generals in the Shenandoah valley. Suggestions were even made as
to how this might be accomplished.
A few active enemies might inflict great injury upon our town and
escape unscathed. "The Wagrant Ordinance is probably adequate to this
emergency, and we beg to call attention of this matter to our worthy
marshal, and hope he will act vigorously and promptly to check any dis-
turbance." (5)
2298 - L. Nov. 2; ed:4/6 - Reports that an attack would be made on this
city last night caused a great deal of excitement among the people.
The origin of the alarm seems to have come from a dispatch sent to Lieu-
tenant Colonel Palmer stationed at Johnson's island, stating that 100
men had left Toronto for the purpºse of pillaging Detroit and Buffalo.
One rumor brought on another and every suspicious-looking person was
questioned. All necessary precautions were taken to insure the safety
as well as the property of the citizens. (15)

shrunk in horror. The people, non-slave holders, the middle classes of
the South, are not enemies of the Union and should seek amnesty from
the government. But the slave drivers and man stealers should be shot,
imprisoned, or exiled.
"The government should, therefore, try to create disaffection in
the ranks of the men who have no interest in the perpetuation of slav-
ery, but let the destroyer of our bravest men, Slavery, die in its
tracks." (10)
2300 - L Nov. 19; ed: 2/2 - When the war first started, people were
under the impression that the Rebellion could be overcome by surrounding
it on all sides and choking it out, anaconda style. After Grant was
placed at the head of the armies this plan was abandoned, and Union
forces massed against points of vital importance to the Rebellion. The
result has been that the Rebels have been out-numbered in all the major
engagements.
"This work of centralizing our strength against the vital points of
the Rebellion must progress still further. The plan certainly looks
practicable from our stand-point." (5)
2301 - L Nov. 30; ed:2/1 - The theory that the recent attempt to burn
New York was made by Rebel emissaries from Richmond is proved by more
recent revelations.
A few weeks ago the Richmond WIIIG suggested a scheme for burning
"one of the chief cities of America."
The WHIG wrote "Nothing could be easier"... "that the men to execute
the work are already there"..." that 20 men with plans all pre-concerted
and means provided, selecting some dry windy night, might fire Boston
in a 100 places" and that "New York is worth 20 Richmonds."
It then recommended an appropriation of $1,000,000 by the rebel author-

desire that the war shall be short, sharp and decisive, and "if men are
needed to make it such, there is no apology needed by Congress if they
do not make it such."
The Union armies need re-enforcement.

2305 - L. Dec. 13; ed:2/1 - It is said that interest and anxiety felt
amorg all classes in England in the war now going on here have not been
exceeded, if equalled, by any war in which England has been engaged. The
liberals and conservatives of Europe feel that their contest has been
transferred to the American battle fields for the present. Cobden, a
man whose integrity and pluck have endeared him to the masses of the
English people, iooked upon the peaceable election held in this country,
Nov. 8 as "one of the sublimest spectacles ever witnessed on earth."
"For our part, it is a source of great satisfaction to us that the

tracts for your columns. You should have the whole but it is too long.
"We cannot deny that the war is a great evil.... But we may venture to
say that there are some wars which are not all evil.... Some say that
we have accomplished little and had better compromise. Accomplished ...
little ! Do we not stand today a self centered nation?... From a nation :
which the world and which itself believed to be sunk in hopeless mammon
worship, we have risen to be a nation that pours out its wealth like
water for a noble purpose. Never again will the almighty dollar be
called America's divinity. We were sinking fast to low and selfish pur-
poses.... But on hearing the summons, millions leaped to offer all they - --
had, to fling fortune, limb, and life on the altar of an unselfish cause,
and proved the readiness of the old faithful manly blood to be as bright
as ever.... Benevolence has become the -atmosphere of the land. Four " ' " .
years ago we would not have believed it; that the voluntary charity of .
Americans would count by millions yearly, and it is still flowing out in
a steady, deep, increasing tide of free, glad giving. And is this .
nothing?'" - - - . . . . . - (15)

WARS - Civil War (Cont'd)
2308 - L Dec. 30; ed:2/1 - A new and important era is to come about in
this country due to the progress of the war. Indications of a change
in political ard foreign relations are apparent, and the Negro question
is an important factor to be considered.
"In all these respects, therefore, the nation is passing into a new
era - to be fought with much zeal and woe to the country. The moral and
physical power of the ration are to be put to a severe test, and whether
the nation shall come forth proudly from the struggle, ... will depend
vastly upon the self-sacrifice, courage and devotion to principle we
shall exhibit during the coming year. The new era is at hand, the past
is buried. Today we must act like men." (17)
(Bandits &amp; Guerrillas)
2309 - L. June 21; ed: 2/2 - "The State of Kentucky will undoubtedly be-
come purified after a while under the manifold afflictions of guerrillas.
There are a balf dozen bands of prowlers in different parts of the
State, whose business it seems to be to pillage upon the inhabitants.
Kentucky Negroes are being rapidly enlisted, and after a while that
would be chivalric State will have defenders. At present, there seems
to be neither spirit, nor loyalty enough among her population, to drive
out bands of land pirates. How soon they would be captured if in the
State of Ohio!" - (2)
2310 - L. July 14:2/2 - In order to check guerrilla warfare on the rail-
roads, General Sherman has ordered some prominent secessionists arrested
and compelled them to ride in cars, in exposed positions.
The same system might be adopted, we believe, on steamers running
up and down the lower Ohio and Mississippi rivers. (2)
2311 - L. July 21; ed:2/1 - Parts of Missouri are in a sad state of af-
fairs due to the terrible acts of cruelty and depredation committed by
guerrillas. It seems that the only way to stop such outrages is to arm
the people and permit them to shoot these guerrillas on sight.
"Something should be done to check the villains who roam through the
State shooting Union men, even if conservatives should be annihilated in
a body." (3)
2312 - L. Dec. 20; ed: 2/1 - The Rebel General Lyon with 2,500 guerrillas
is burning and ravaging in western Kentucky. Now located on the Cumber-
land river, which he controls, his object is to conscript for the Rebel
army and destroy railroads and stores.
"We hope to hear soon of his defeat and capture." (2)
2313 - L. Dec. 23; ed:2/2 - General E. D. McCook has routed the guerrilla,
General Lyon, who has been raiding in western Kentucky. -
"This band of robbers, horse-thieves and murderers ought to be utterly
annihilated, and we trust it will be." (2)

court house resolutions were adopted by that body expressing respect
for the memory of its departed members.
A committee cf five was appointed to receive the remains of the dead
soldiers, among the members being Judge J. P. Bishop, N. B. Sherwin,
and W. C. McFarland.
Judge Bishop, in his adāress on the death of Captain Philpot, said:
"Knowing him as I do, I can bear testimony to his uniform, correct habits
and integrity. Though apparently diffident, when responsibility de-
volved upon him he never shrank from it, but performed it with unwonted
firmness and integrity. -
"It was the discovery of this trait of character that caused me to
advise him to enter the service of the country, and do what he could to
aid in the suppression of the rebellion."
W. C. McFarland spoke principally about Captain Hutchinson, saying,
"I was well and 1ntimately acquainted with him. He was my classmate in
law school. In my judgment his was not one of those great overshadowing
minds which so readily grasp the philosophy, and dive deep into the
bowels of the law, but he was a man of ordinary capacity, with remarkable
industry." (52)

2341 - L Dec. 7; ed: 2/1 - A paper contributed and read by E. B. Elliot
of Washington before the British association for the promotion of science
disproves assertions that this war has cost more lives than any other. Sta-
tistics showing the mortality rate of the Mexican, the Crimean, and

"The differences are chiefly due to the better care taken of our

ing. The friends of these last will be gratified to learn that each of

WARS - Civil War (Confederate Army) (Cont'd)
2348 - L. Sept. 21; ed:2/1 - "It is astonishing, that, notwithstanding
the terrible evils which the rebellion has brought upon the South, the
Rebel leaders have been able to hold in an iron grip the armies which
they have organized." The reason for this is that while the rank and
file of the Southern army have physical courage, they lack moral cour-
age to rebel against their leaders. So long as the Rebel armies are
unbroken the villains are capable of wielding such a despotism as is
unknown in any other part of the globe. If they are deprived of their
power and are left to the mercies of a cruelly outraged South they
will have no resting place for their feet on this continent.
"Let there be no negotiation with the Rebel leaders, but let them
be dealt with all the energy of force until their power is destroyed."
(15)
2349 - L Nov. 11; ed: 2/2 - The war has made many changes in the condition
of the Rebel and the Union armies. The Rebels had the advantage in the
beginning, due to the fact that many young men who had attended military
schools in the South were ready to take command of their troops. Many
officers who were considered to be the best became identified with the
Rebellion. These advantages were at first noticeable in the superior
discipline of Rebel soldiers when brought in contact with the raw
recruits of the North. However, years of war changed these conditions.
The Rebel soldiers became an undisciplined, thieving, and disorganized
army, more dangerous to the South than to the Northern armies.
"It is so long since the Rebels have had a great victory, that they
have become habituated to defeat, and will grow more and more so as the
pressure of our armies continues.... We have the men, means and money,
and now that the people have triumphantly re-elected Abraham Lincoln,
the day cannot be very far hence when the Rebellion must utterly cease
from the land." (10)
(Confiscation)
2350 - L. Feb. 3; ed: 2/2, 6 - In his Congressional speech on confiscation
of Confederate property, the Ilon. James A. Garfield declared that such
confiscation was justified by the action of the South. He said in part:
"When the government of the United States declared that we were in
a state of war, the rebel states came under the laws of war. By their
acts of rebellion they swept away every vestige of their civil and polit-
ical rights under the constitution of the United States. Their obli-
gations still remained, but the reciprocal rights which usually accompany
obligations, they had forfeited.
"The question then lies open before us: In a state of war, is this
resolution legal and politic?
"I remember to have said to a friend when I entered the army, 'You
hate slavery; so do I; but I hate disunion more. Let us drop the
slavery question and fight to sustain the Union."
"Mr. Speaker, I am surprised and amazed beyond measure at what I have

seen in this House. Having been so long with men who had but one
thought upon these great themes, it is passing strange to me to hear
men talking of the old discussions of a few years ago. They forget
that a nation sometimes may live a generation into a single year and
the experience of the last three years has been greater than that of
centuries of peace and quiet.
"If we want peace that is not a hollow peace, we must make thorough
work of this war. We must establish freedom in the midst of servitude,
and the authority of law in the midst of rebellion. We must fill the
ranks of our armies, assure them that a grateful and loving people are
behind them and they will go down against the enemy bearing with them
the majesty and might of a great nation.
"The war began by proclamation and it must end by proclamation."
Mr. Garfield's speech cuts so directly down to the heart of the whole
question of confiscation that our readers will be glad to read it. It
has been spoken of as the most effective speech made in Congress this
session." (106)
2351 - L. Feb. 18; ed: 2/1 - The conscription act awaits its passing in the
Senate. It confiscates the real estate of the Rebel, in fee, and not
for life simply.
"The battle fields of the Republic must not be owned by the Rebels
and slave lords." (6)
(Enlistments &amp; Confiscations)
2352 - L. Jan. 5:4/3,4 - Fourth ward citizens met on Jan. 1 in the
engine house to celebrate the exemption of the ward from the draft.
Mainly through the efforts of Captain Walendar the quota has been re-
cruited from the young men of the ward, and in token of his services
and untiring efforts, a splendid sword was presented him by John C.
Grannis, in behalf of the citizens of the ward. -
An elegant gold headed cane was given to D. A. Dangler in appreciation
of his services as treasurer and chairman of the recruiting committee.
Relief work was spoken of, and much credit is due this ward for their
efforts in caring for the families of soldiers. (27)
2353 - L. Jan. 5; ed:4/4 - One thousand men, more or less, in the first

Several thousand dollars must yet be raised in order to complete the

"Pennsylvania is redeemed of the stain on her Judiciary." (3)
2360 - L. Jan. 26; ed:4/2 - When the draft was anticipated in this city,
ten boxes containing 200 muskets were sent here as a precaution against

ing. Later they were shipped to Lieutenant Colonel Whitely, Allegheny
arsenal, Pittsburgh. It is a safe indication that Cleveland is out of

2362 - L Jan. 28; ed: 2/3 - Governor Bramlette of Kentucky refuses leave to
a recruiting officer to recruit free colored men in the state. "This will
please the slave owners; it is to their interest to have negroes refused.
But whether it will please the free white workingmen who must leave their
families while the blacks stay at home to work for their masters, remains
to be seen." - (7)
2363 - L. Feb. 3; ed:2/1 - There is evidence from all quarters that re-en-
listment will fill many quotas. The draft bill passed by Congress awaits

"If the work is taken hold of immediately our quota will be reached by
the end of the month." - . (6)
2364 - L. Feb. 10; ed: 2/1 - "The call of the President for new troops galls
the Copperhead ideas of justice and liberty. We would like to 'swap'
them for good Union men in the South so that they might try the mild bene-
ficent sway of Jeff Davis for a season. They could then compare the two
systems of oppression. For their special edification we print to-day an
analysis of the Rebel conscription law.... Truly the Southern people seem
destined to drink the cup of oppression to the dregs." (6)

hurry from Germany and Ireland to clutch the blood money of Stanton, and
hire themselves out to mercenary murderers in a foreign quarrel, are the

"John (Bull) has undoubtedly forgotten the days when he employed the

2407 - L June 28; ed: 2/2 - It is proposed to recruit in New York city as
follows: A committee of citizens has been appointed and members of the
committee will pay to the treasurer $350 or $400. Their names will be
placed on a list in the order the money is received and gentlemen will be
given exempticn papers in the order in which their names are found on the
list. -
"A system of recruiting of this kind, aided by government bounties,
would add greatly to the army." - (5)
2408 - L June 28; ed:2/1 - A very important debate occurred in the house
of lords, in which the question of federal recruiting was discussed. The
opponents of the government made a violent effort to prove that the con-
tinuation of the war is wholly due to the fact that foreigners, especially
the subjects of the queen, are enlisted into the federal army. The Marquis
of Clauricade made the statement that "if the proper measures had been
taken to prevent it long ago, the civil war in America would have ended
before now; and if the recruiting of British subjects were now put a stop
to," he believed the war would be brought to an early end.
"From these features of the discussion it is also clear that tile question
of intervention is liable to come up in a new phase before long.
"Success of our armies can alone prevent it. Every energy should there-
fore be put forth to accomplish the work to be done, this summer." (10)
2409 - L. June 28; ed: 2/1, 2 - "There is doubt if the Commutation bill will

"A proper system of enterprise and use of the money obtained by commu-
tation will enable the agents of the states to fill up their quotas." (7)

that two were held for service, two furnished substitutes, ten paid com-
mutation, and two were exempted for physical disability.
The quota for this district is 975. Under this quota we have had three...
drafts. The first draft called for 975, the first supplemental draft for

(11)
2412 - L June 30; ed: 2/1,2 - Congress has now reached an important con-
clusion regarding drafting and volunteering. As the bill now stands, the
President is authorized to call for any number of volunteers to whom boun-
ties will be paid in the following way:
These serving one year to receive $200; two years, $300; three years,
$400. In case the quota of any township or county is not raised within
60 days, the President is authorized to order a draft for one year. In
case of draft no commutation is to be allowed, but those who go as drafted
men, or substitutes, are to receive bounties in the same manner as volun-
teers.
"We regard the act as probably the best that could be made, so long as
the commutation clause is abolished." (15)
2413 - L. July 1:2/1 - The passing of a law authorizing ward trustees to
levy a $100 tax makes it possible to recruit the army by giving bounties
to volunteers. The money raised by townships in addition to government
bounty will soon fill up the quotas.
"The entire strength of the nation through loyal representatives is
given to the government." (2)
2414 - L July 2; ed: 2/1 - Indignation arises because the provost marshal
general of Ohio proposed a plan of supplementary draft of those who are
drafted and fail to respond.
This order shifts the responsibility from the government to the people
without just cause. Men failing to report should be arrested. But to
draft other citizens to supply the deficiency arouses just indignation. (4)
2415 - L. July 2:2/1 - A new plan by provost marshals, making it possible
for persons exempt from the draft to send substitutes, is quite successful.
This is an opportunity for wealthy ladies to be represented in the army.

cept Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana. -
The bill was passed because Senators and Representatives feared anarch
if a way was not provided for replenishing the army. (3)
2418 - H July 5; ed: 1/2 - "It is poor policy to pay from $100 to $500 to
alien substitutes for the army - substitutes whose only cbject in going
into this war is the pay - and refuse, as substitutes, native American
citizens of color, who have stomach for the fight, and whose war cry is
'Wictory or Death.'" (5)
2419 - L. July 13; ed:2/1 - By a system of organized efforts, speculators
manage to rob recruits of one-half to three-fourths of the bounty paid by
those who put representative men into the army. These crooks deserve
proper and speedy punishment. Many citizens are considering adopting
measures similar to the plans adopted in New York so that the bounty will
go directly to recruits.
"It is the duty of all citizens to warn those proposing to enlist
against the villainous brokers who plunder their innocent victims of most
of their bounty." - - - - - - - (9)
2420 - L. July 14; ed:4/3 - Amos Coe, a not too well loved character in
this city, and one who has been loud in his threats against the govern-
ment, changed his tune on being notified of his being drafted and with
tears in his eyes begged for an extension of time to pay commutation.
Captain Nash granted his plea until July 12. At that time when Coe failed
to appear, a search for him was instituted, but he could not be found.
"We trust that every effort for his arrest may be put forth, for a
great and just dissatisfaction would arise if any decent man has to be
drafted to fill the place of so villainous a bully and Copperhead as Coe."
(7)
2421 - L July 14; ed:4/3 - The worst evil resulting from the present draft
system is the substitute broker, who procures men for $50 or $100 and sells
them to drafted men for $400 or $500, -
"We are glad to see that recruiting officers of this city have united
in a card to the people suggesting greater caution in dealing with this
set of men." - - (7)
2422 - L. July 16; ed:2/2 - Repealing the commutation clause was the wisest
thing to do. Liberal bounties will encourage men, and the army will have
its full quota in short time. It is the duty of every man to do his
share, and men in Cleveland who are physically exempt, but "who are grow-
ing richer as a consequence of the war," should be proud to put a man
into service. . (3)

2423 - L July 20; ed: 2/1 - It is evident by the late call for volunteers
that war is about to begin in earnest. The South has for some time been
concerned with war as a serious business, while the North has been paying
more attention to commerce and manufacturing, consequently growing rich.
Now, however, the North has rallied and is doing its share to keep fill ing
up the army. Five hundred thousand men are to be added to the army, which
will constitute a reserve force with which the last vestige of treason is
to be obliterated. (9)
2424 - L. July 21:4/3 - The city council met last night and adopted the
following resolution: That a city military committee be appointed to adopt
means most efficient for the purpose of procuring the required number of
men to fill the quota of Cleveland under the last call of the President
for volunteers for military service. \2)
2425 - H Aug. 5:1/5 - Provost Marshal Nash has received orders to accept
substitutes before the draft for one, two, or three years. (1)
2426 - H Aug. 5: 1/5 - On Aug. 3 a party of plantation Negroes who had es-
caped from a farm in Southern Alabama arrived here. Yesterday they were
mustered into the service as substitutes for enrolled Cleveland men. (5)
2427 - H Aug. 5: 1/5 - Recruiting for Cleveland was livelier yesterday, a
number of contrabands having enlisted as substitutes. (1)
2428 - H Aug. 5: 1/5 - Yesterday, two contrabands were being taken to Buffalo
by-some "broker" who offered them $50 to enlist in the army. Some colored
men on the train heard of the swindle, and persuaded the contrabands to
stop off here, where they could get $300 or $400. The broker objected, and
a fight started. Two men were jailed, and the contrabands locked up for
safe keeping. - * - (3)
2429 - H Aug. 5; ed: 1/2 - To fill the quota in New York city, which is
19,000 under the half million call, the bounty has been raised from $325
to $600, making the sum necessary to get the recruits $11,400,000.
"It looks like a pretty big burden, but it is really nothing to the
rich comiuercial center. Half a score of the merchant princes could raise
the sum in an hour. Will they stand this test of their patriotism?" (2)
2430 - L. Aug. 15; ed: 2/1 - Immediately upon the call for 500,000 men and
the passage of a bill permitting recruiting in Rebel states, much anxiety
was manifested to fill up quotas by the use of money amongst Negroes of
disloyal states. Agents from the east and North have gone South to offer
higher bounty than is offered in the west.
Southerners resent having men from the North try to buy men and take
their places in the army, and suggest rightfully that the Northerners share
time heat and burden of the war as they are doing.

The draft is certain to take a large number of able bodied men. In-
stead of waiting to be drafted, if men will volunteer, there will be left a
large bounty for dependents; but if drafted there will be left little or .
nothing. Substitutes will command from $1,000 to $1,500, and none but the
rich can hope to secure them.
"Let these facts be understood generally. Do not place your independence
on recruiting agencies in the Scuth." (10)
2431 - L Aug. 20:4/5 - The city recruiting office will close and no fur-
ther efforts will be made to raise the quota, which is 1, 100 of which, about.
150 has been raised. The reason is that Cleveland will only pay $100 for
each recruit, while others cities pay up to $500. (7)
2432 - L. Aug. 25; ed: 2/3 - In certain counties unscrupulous men have arcused
the passions and prejudices of people until they are almost in open rebel-
lion at the coming draft.
Resistance to the laws of the United States is treason, punishable by
death, and those who contemplate resistance must expect the consequences.
"The period has almost arrived to order the draft, and all law abidirg
citizens will abide the consequences and will discountenance anything like
resistance." - - (7)
2433 - L. Aug. 27; ed: 2/1 - Much anxiety is felt concerning the draft to be
made Sept. 5, which will add 300,000 men to Sheriuan's and Grant's armies.
These new recruits will enable Sherman to send men to Georgia to rescue
Union prisoners and overthrow Rebel forces there.
The way for the law-abiding citizen is clear. If he cannot go, let him
send a substitute if possible. Better that sacrifices be made than that
our armies should be abandoned and the Rebellion succeed. (14)
2434 - L. Aug. 29; ed: 2/1 - The draft to take place Sept. 5, as announced
by the President, will not be postponed, though he has been asked by
cowards who fear its effects upon them and various other schemers to post-
pone it to give the country a chance to fill the quota by volunteering.
"Every motive, whether of policy or patriotism, united in urging an
immediate enforcement of the draft. Let us bear its heavy burden cheer-
fully and faithfully, looking beyond our present sacrifice to the glori-
ous vintage that could not else have been." (18)
2435 - L. Aug. 30; cq:2/3 - Orders from General Heintzleman forbidding re-
ception, transportation, or delivery of arms and ammunition by railroads,
or their sale in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, except by special permit,
is a wise move. Due to threats of open resistance of the draft, authori-
ties feel it necessary to take every precaution against insurrection and
civil war.
"There can be no doubt of the intention of the Copperhead leaders to make
the forthcoming draft the occasion of rousing their inflamed and higated (sic)
fellowmen to open resistance. This embargo on powder and lead now, may
save the terrible expenditure of powder and lead a month hence." (8)

2436 - L Sept. 1:4/3 - The city council met last night and adopted the
following resolution: The finance committee be authorized to pay $100
bounty to all men included in the draft who secured the enlistment of a
volunteer as substitute for themselves. (3)
2437 - L. Sept. 3:4/5 - "After laboring with the people of the ward (Fourth)
for some two weeks and finding that nearly one-half of the enrolled men
of the ward have been called upon in vain; and entirely refuse to contrib-
ute, it was determined to suffer the ward to be drafted for the small
number of men lacking."
At a meeting held at the engine house, on Sept. 2, a resolution was
adopted "that any person, who has contributed to the ward fund, under the
recent call for five hundred thousand men, may take any number of shares
at ten dollars each, in an association, this evening, formed for mutual
protection of any who shall be drafted from said association."
The shares will be ready for delivery Sept. 10. (4)
2438 - L Sept. 6; ed: 2/1 - The course of the government is condemned as
unwise in lessening quotas by giving credits for men enlisted. "What we
want is men, and not a way to get rid of the responsibility, which de-
volves on every American citizen." (2)
2439 - L. Sept. 8:4/3 - A resolution was adopted authorizing the finance
committee to pay a city bounty of $100 to men who volunteer for service
whether as substitutes for drafted men or for themselves. (2)
2440 - L. Sept. 17; ed:2/1 - In many portions of the country the draft has
been set for Sept. 19. This will make an addition of at least 100,000
effective men to the forces of Generals Sherman and Grant.
"The addition of 100,000 men to our armies will do much to make the
fall campaign a successful one. The last efforts of the rebels are being
put forth. If they do not succeed this fall, they will give up the con-
test.... The draft will show the rebels that they have no hope in an anti-
war party in the north." (5)
2441 - L. Sept. 17; ed: 2/1 - The draft on Sept. 19 is to give Grant and
Sherman at least 100,000 more men.
"Everyone urges the draft because the enforcement of the law will mani-
fest a power resident in our government. Our government, though a democ-
racy, should in times of trouble and danger be able to wield the power
of a great nation." (5)
2442 - L. Oct. 6; ed:2/2 - Deserters, refugees, and cowards who have fled
to Canada from the United States are to be enrolled in new regiments, and
the order requiring them to become enrollied is causing consternation
among the sneaks and cowards. "It is a sorry road to travel when a man,
by slinking off to a foreign country, seeks to escape duties which every
man owes to his 'Fatherland.'" -

2443 - H Nov. 25:3/2 - Drafted men who have not reported to the provost
marshal are deserters and will be treated as such. Any person capturing
one receives $30. - (1)
2444 - H Nov. 25:3/3 - Orders from the provost marshal general have been
received by the board of enrollment to correct the enrollment lists of the
18th district. - - (4)
2445 - L. Nov. 30; ed: 2/1 - It is certain that the repeated drafts made un-
der the conscription laws passed last winter have failed to add to the -
strength of the army. * - . . .
The law is defective in allowing persons to avoid the draft for reasons: -
which excite the laughter and ridicule of the people, and yet may be strict-
ly in conformity with the law.
"If something is not done, the draft will become a ridiculous farce as
well as a consiant vexation to the people." (4)
2446 - L. Dec. 8:4/3 - Rev. J. S. C. Abbott spoke last night at Brain- -
ard's hall on "Our War and General Grant." He related the incident of Gen-
eral Grant's firing a pistol at the age of two; also of the drubbing he
gave an English boy for calling Washington a traitor. He gave a summary
of events which occurred in the private and public life of General Grant
and closed his remarks by alluding to the peace-and-armistice element, in
a delightful and comprehensive manner. (8)
2447 - L. Dec. 14; ed:2/1 - Two weeks have passed since enlistments started
in General Hancock's new corps, but it is filling up rapidly and will
probably be organized by Jan. 1. A recruit may enlist for one, two, or
three years and will receive $300 from the substitute fund in regular in- .
stallments from the government in proportion to the period of enlistment.
The distinction of being a member of this corps will call out an entirely
different class of recruits from the mercenary ones.
"The country needs men, and prompt enforcements of our gallant armies -
will insure speedy close of the war. We are led to make these remarks
from the fact that recruiting in this district is progressing slowly. We
trust that this state of things may no longer be allowed to exist." (20)
2448 - L. Dec. 21; ed: 2/1 - President Lincoln has sent out a call for 300,000
more troops. "It shows that the government is determined to push foward
the war until the rebellion is put down. All that remains to do is for -
wards and townships to go to work." (2)
2449 - H Dec. 27:3/3 - A large meeting of the enrolled men of the sixth
ward was held yesterday at the wigwam. A committee was appointed to cor-
rect the enrollment list. - (3)

2450 - L Dec. 30:4/3 - The enrolled men of the sixth ward met on Dec. 28
and organized a "Sixth Ward Self-Protection Club." W. P. Fogg was elected
president; John Huntington, vice president; George A. Kolbe, secretary,
and G. W. Calkins, treasurer.
The object of this club is to protect such of its members as may be
drafted, but not to clear the ward nor to relieve from the draft those
who will give neither time nor money for that purpose. (4)
(Desertions)
2451 - L Mar. 28:4/3 - A German living on Detroit st. joined the army, then
deserted. The captain of his company took a squad of soldiers and went
to his house, but found nothing. When they were about to leave, the cap-
tain thought he heard a noise in a bed and ordered the bed riddled with
bayonets. A butcher crawled out from under the mattress and fled from the
house. The German has not yet been found. (9)
2452 - L. Mar. 31:4/2 - Jack Adams was arrested yesterday and locked up on
the charge of encouraging a soldier to desert. He will be brought before
Commissioner White. (1)
2453 - L Apr. 30:4/4 - Robert Martin, who is charged with being a bounty
jumper, leaped out of the water closet window in an effort to escape while
on a train enroute to Columbus. Lieutenant Reeves of the 19th Ohio bat-
tery scarched Martin's home and caught him. (3)
2454 - L. May 13:4/2 - Michael Kelly of the 32nd New York regiment was ar-
rested by Policemen Furnal and Marshall on the charge of desertion. (1)
2455 - L June 15:4/2 - A deputy provcst marshal came here in search of
three deserters. The three boarded a train at the Bristol station. The
marshal, unable to capture them, fired at them, hitting one, who is not
expected to live. (2)
2456 - H Nov. 25:3/2 - The provost marshal's force yesterday arrested Hen-
ry Thomas, charged with desertion from a Minnesota regiment. He has been
in Cleveland for a year or two. (1)
(Military Engagements &amp; Campaigns)
2457 - L. Jan. 18; ed: 2/3 - We have General Meade's opinion on when the
army of the Potomac will advance, and when the war will close. He says:
"We are making every effort to improve the present, and as soon as the
weather moderates and the season will allow, active operations will com-
mence in earnest. The war must be ended by the hard fighting people's
work. Peace will possibly be here next summer." (3)

WARS - Civil War (Military Engagements &amp; Campaigns) (Cont'd)
2458 - L. Jan. 23; ed: 2/1 - There is a lull in military affairs. Plans for
the spring and summer campaigns are brewinº. The hopes of the Rebels so.
far are crushed. They hold out, mainly waiting for new results under a
new administration. Grant thinks they look to the conservatives for res-
toration. General Jackson can't muster more than 100,000 men. General
Grant has 20,000 more, but with the serious handicap of operations hundreds
of miles away.
"Let the authorities be strong and vigilant. Let them not lose the
golden hour for the concentration of all scattered energies. Let every
available man in the west be forwarded to Grant." - (17)
2459 - L Feb. 18; ed: 2/1 - The expedition to seize the military triangle
formed by Mobile, Meridan, and Selma offers vast military possibilities.
Control of these cities means control of the most defensible stronghold in
the gulf states.
"We shall witness a combination of military power that will strike the
center of the Rebellion and drive the scattered forces to the circumference
where but a short life awaits them." (9)
2460 - L. Feb. 27; ed: 2/2 - General Sherinan is completely swallowed up in the
gulf states. His movements and intentions seem to be a matter of conjecture
and speculation.
"If Sherman once reaches Montgomery, he is about as far from Atlanta as
Chattanooga." - (6)
2461 - L. Mar. 4; ed: 2/1 - A New York WORLD blames President Lincoln for the
slaughter of the soldiers at Olustee.
"No one but a brainless idiot or a mercenary scribbler would dare assert
that Lincoln paid down the lives of 1,200 Union soldiers for three elector-
ial votes in Florida." (4)
2462 - L. Mar. 4; ed: 2/2 - Sherman's boldest movement is to maintain himself
on the Alabama river, which will prove a damaging blow to the Rebels.
"Evidently south Alabama is, for a time, to be the theater of important
military movements." - (4)
2463 - L. Mar. 7; ed: 2/1 - No reports have been received yet as to the where-
abouts of General Sherman. One newspaper calls him a military shuttle.
While Sherman is thus striking blows in the Rebellion, "let us listen to
the blandishments of the telegraph until the truth is revealed." (17)
2464 - L. Mar. 10; ed: 2/1 - Since the defeat of General Seymour at Olustee,
our forces have remained in front of Jacksonville. No apprehension exists
of an attack in this new position.
"Our troops are represented as not at all discouraged." (4)

2465 - L. Mar. 11; ed: 2/1 - The country is generally disappointed in the
recent raids of Logan, Smith, Kilpatrick, and Sherman. It shows how an-
xious people are for decisive blows. "Our policy is evidently to concen-
trate, the Rebels, to scatter." f (9)
2466 - L. Mar. 23; ed:2/1 - The whole country is in an expectant mood, wait-
ing eagerly for the first movements which General Grant will make to crush
the Rebellion and bring peace to a distracted country.
"That General Grant and his brave men may be saviors of our country is
the prayer of every year." (13)
2467 - L. Mar. 31; ed: 2/1 - "There is something loose" in Kentucky and west-
ern Tennessee that the Rebel raider, Forrest, has been allowed to penetrate
from Mississippi as far North as the Ohio river. -
"If he is allowed to make his escape, it will reflect no credit on our
cavalry-men operating in that region." (8)
2468 - L. Apr. 7; ed: 2/1 - Everybody awaits the spring campaign, the weather
now making military movements impossible. The Rebels can only maintain a
defensive war. -
"We have tried generals and soldiers. We have a righteous cause. We
have every promise of success and we have a very large army." (18)
2469 - L Apr. 12; ed: 2/1 - Notwithstanding the perfection of plans on
paper, the American people must be permitted to make shrewd guesses about
the war.
"However the criticisms of plans may result, let us nevertheless trust
that the doom of treason is at hand." - (9)
2470 - L Apr. 15; ed: 2/1 - Within a few weeks, General Grant will marshal
an army of 250,000 against Richmond.
"Let the army of General Grant be sustained by the hearty support of the
people." (6)
2471 - L. Apr. 18; ed: 2/1 - Both in the army and navy there has been of late
a criminal neglect of duty. The MAPLE LEAF was destroyed in St. John's
river, and the frigate MINNESOTA barely escaped destruction by a Rebel
ram. Forts Pillow and Paducah have been captured by the South. It is im-
possible to believe that the Rebels must be allowed to occupy Tennessee and
Kentucky. - (3)
2472 - L. Apr. 25; ed:2/1 - By a brilliant "coup de main," the Rebels were
led into a position (in Louisiana) where they were slaughtered with im-
mense havoc.
"This final victory puts a new phase upon affairs in western Louisiana
and promises the final expulsion of the rebels from that region." (3)

2473 - L Apr. 25; ed: 2/1 - Great excitement rages over the army of the
Potomac. General Grant is the one man upon whom the fortunes of the re- ...
public rest. The President has committed entire control over the vast
military resources to General Grant. "He can move upon Richmond by sev-
eral routes. We believe therefore, there is ground for strong confidence
in the success of, 'Unconditional Surrender Grant.'" (12)
2474 - L Apr. 28; ed:2/1 - Recent Rebel demonstrations indicate their part
is to distract the attention of General Grant in order to make a division
of his forces. "The grand policy of concentration is therefore to be per-
severed in, notwithstanding these raids on the outsides of the centers of
war." - (6)
2475 - L. May 11; ed: 2/1 - The disastrous expedition of General Banks has
ended with high hopes for its success blasted. "This certainly is a
terrible revulsion from the pleasant picture conjured up by the people of
rebel hordes driven away into the winds of Texas and completely demoralized
and routed." - (7)
2476 - L. May 11; ed: 2/1 - Generals Grant, Hancock, Burnside, and Butler are
gradually forcing Lee back into Richmond. - - -
"Unless Lee can defeat the three armies closing on Richmond, which is
altogether improbable, nothing but surrender or terrible rout, retreat, and
ruin awaits him and all his crew." (12)
2477 - L. May 12; ed:2/1 - Military matters in Virginia still remain un-
decided. General Lee's army is in the vicinity of Spottsylvania, while
General Grant's is in the immediate vicinity, recuperating before moving
on. "On the whole, the horizon is brightening all the while." (6)
2477 1/2 - L. May 13; ed: 2/1 - No, equal area on the continent has more
natural facilities for defense than southeastern Virginia where Lee is en-
trenched. Grant is cool, tenacious, with stubborn fierceness of purpose,
while Lee has southern temperment which throws him with fierce energy upon
his enemy. -
"The courage displayed by both armies on so many battle fields will be a
bond in the future Union. Each will regard the personal prowess of the
other more highly." - (12)
2478 - L. May 13; ed: 2/3 - In Nashville federal troops appeared in the city
streets and seized over 500 horses. The streets were full of teams and
carriages. "If royal Richard were to offer his kingdom for a horse in . . .
Nashville, chances are he would not get one." (2)
2479 - L. May 16; ed:2/1 - General Sherman is operating in rough country -
Rocky Face ridge, Snake Creek gap, Tunnell Hill, and Buzzard Roost.

"The veterans of Lookout Mountain, will find a way to smoke out the
snakes and astonish the buzzards." (1)
2480 - L May 16; ed: 2/1 - The terrific fighting of May 12 and the movements
of our cavalry have completed the withdrawal of Lee from Grant's front in
the direction of Danville and Lynchburg. Generals Sherman and Butler are
in positions to advance toward victory. "The retreat of Lee has undoubted-
ly by this time become a rout. The strength and spirit and moral prestige
of the Rebel army have gone." (11)
2481 - L May 19; ed: 2/1 - There is a lull in the storm of battle in Wir-
ginia. Grant is caring for his wounded and getting reinforcements in
preparation for the last desperate attempt to conquer Lee.

be annihilated, and peace will soon dwell in all our borders." (10)
2482 - L. May 21; ed: 2/1 - The Rebel general, Johnston, has been worsted at

2483 - L. May 26; ed:2/1 - Grant has driven Lee back from his stronghold
around Orange court house. Grant with his large army has outflanked Lee,
maneuvering him out of his works with little loss.
"News from Canby and Sherman is excellent and promises that we shall
have better news. The whole sky looks bright." - (9)
2484 - L. May 27; ed: 2/1 - The latest information represents Grant and
Sherman crowding Lee into Richmond. Butler has entrenchments south of
Richmond, leaving the Rebels no escape. "With Richmond in Grant's posses-
sion, a like result must follow in the East. We have a strong conviction
that success awaits our arms." (11)
2485 - L. May 31; ed: 2/1 - Sherman's troops met the Rebel army at Dallas,
Ga., and defeated them, losing 300 and capturing 2,500, thus giving him a
change of base to the Alabatua river. -
"The only fear is that Johnston may have quietly reinforced Lee. If
so, Sherman will find plenty to do." (9)
2486 - L June 1; ed:2/1 - The magnificent movement of Grant, by which he
placed himself within a few miles of Richmond, completely outwitting Lee,
is troubling the Northern "Copperheads."
"This movement is already the subject of sore lamentation among them,
and consequently, they effect to disparage its importance as much as
possible." - (3)

2487 - L June 8; ed: 2/1 - Grant has been maneuvering for a position along.
the line of Chickahominy, and attacking the enemy for two days. The sev-
eral attempts inade to push the Rebels back in to Richmond Lave been unsuc-. A
cessful.
"It is probably therefore, that the most desperate battle of the cam- T
paign is yet to be fought on the ground now occupied by the two armies.
We await the result with undiminished confidence in our soldiers and our
leader." - - - - - -- (9)
2488 - L June 9; ed:2/1 - The battle fought June 3 was a defeat for the
Union soldiers. Lee was too strongly fortified, and Grant withdrew. "We
have tested the enemy's strength, and felt his position. The drift of the
fighting is all in one direction, and Grant goes steadily on toward
Richmond, now the turning point of the war." - (9)
2489 - L June 9; ed: 2/4 - Opposite Natchez, Miss., a force of Union black
troops were sent to disperse a force of Rebels. The latter were badly
whipped. One captive begged to be saved. When the Union soldiers asked
the advice of their captain, the latter replied, "Do with him as he would
do with you." The Union soldier thereupon shot the Rebel captive. . . . .
"This may be considered severe by some timid Mississippi Nancies (Sic)
but to all such we say, 'Remember Fort Pillow.'" (3)
2490 - L June 10; ed: 1/2 - Grant has passed all lines to reach his objective,
Richmond. He is now on the line of McClellan's peninsular campaign. "Will
he cross it? It would certainly be in the line of his mode of action to
do so." (2)
2491 - L June 10; ed: 2/2 - General Hunter, defeated the Rebel forces under
Jones, and now occupies Staunton.
Lee called in the main force, heretofore detailed for the protection of
vital points. "One other evidence” of the terrible stress put upon him by
the operations of General Grant." . (5)
2492 - L June 11; ed: 2/2 - Two roads cross at Cold, or Coal Harbor, the
scene of the cavalry fight between. Fitzhugh Lee and Sheridan. One of them
leads from Grant's army to the base of his supplies. Lee lost his fight.
"Its failure was as signal as its success would have been important." (3)
2493 - L. June 13:3/2 - In a letter to the editor, N. F. Barrett says: "At
Coal Harbor we remained but a day or two, while General Custer destroyed
the railroad bridge over Mecump's creek on the Central road in the rear of
Lee's army. This accomplished, we moved back to White House, on the
Pamunkey river, where we again received rations and forage." (20)

Let us have faith in the soldiers of the Republic." - (8)
2497 - L June 18; ed:2/1 - Grant has thrown his army against the rebel
capital, Richmond. Lee must stake everything by coming out and fighting
Grant in the open. Hancock, crossing the James at Fort Powhattan, has

sition at Bermuda Hundred.
"We may now look for very stirring and interesting news from that quar-
ter of the military horizon. God grant victory to our arms." (8)
2498 - L June 21; ed: 2/1 - The whole Rebel army is reported to be in front
of Petersburg, Lee's army having withdrawn from the north of Richmond in
order to meet the new movement of Grant.
"It is generally conceded that Lee will defend Petersburg with all his
power; the loss of its southern connections would be fatal." (7)
2499 - L. July 4; ed:2/1 - The people are in a more hopeful state of mind
since word has been received of Lee's set-back by the destruction of
Danville and Weldon roads. Constructed of strap rails, they were easily
destroyed.
If people are patient, our armies are sure to march to victory and push
the enemy to the wall. (7)
2500 - L. July 4; ed:2/2 - One year ago today General Grant took Wicksburg,
and while the North is doing homage to the memories of the day, Grant is

both are filled with the same spirit as animated the heroes of the Revolu-
tion. (3)

writes of the part played by the sixth cavalry in Sheridan's raid, and de-
scribes the condition of Spottsylvania battlefield, and says that old,
worn-out, lame, and gray plantation hands rushed out to greet the soldiers
and express joy in their freedom. One old gray-haired mother said: "Bress

2503 - L. July 14; ed: 2/1 - The country has quieted down since the last
Rebel Raid, though Baltimore and cities on the Atlantic coast are fearful
lest they will be the next victims of the Rebels.
"We hope that the Rebels received a royal welcome as they approached the
rifle pits and fortifications around Washington." (6)
2504 - L. July 15; ed: 2/1 - People in Maryland and Pennsylvania are panicky
over recent Rebel raids. Fifteen thousand Rebels landed in the vicinity
of Washington and remained over night, but forces in Maryland and Washing-
ton should catch every one of them.
It is hoped that such a ridiculous panic will cease. Raids in the west
don't set the people shivering with mortal terror, and the fright of the
east is supremely disgusting. - (4)
2505 - L. July 19; ed:2/2 - After three years of war, General Sherman has
led his army through 500 miles of enemy territory to the city limits of
Atlanta, the center of the railroad system of the gulf states, and an im-
portant place for government workshops and iron works.
"Ohio may take genuine pride in the success of Sherman, as most of our
troops are with him. Let us award all Honor and Gratitude to the brave
Army of the Cumberland." º (8)
2506 - L. July 20; ed: 2/2 - The expedition of 20,000 men under General A.
J. Smith, on its way to Montgomery or Selma, has met with success.
Another important expedition, under General Rousseau, is also headed
for Selma or Montgomery and will probably meet Smith enroute and inflict
great damage to the enemy, as General Johnston cannot spare a man to re-
pel them.
If they reach Selma, the Union force will move on to Mobile or Mont-
gomery. "We watch with the greatest interest, this important expedition."

2507 - L. July 20:2/3 - In a letter to the editor, N. A. Barrett from a

Petersburg. "It is a mystery how they escaped, as their horses were

rebel pursuit, and after three days on the battlefield, reached our present
camp, and are making preparations to move on to Maryland." (14)
2508 - L. July 23; ed:4/1 - Atlanta, the most important point to the gulf
states, has been captured by General Sherman. His next step will be in
the direction of Augusta, and the seizure of the same would mean the sepa-
ration of the Confederacy into two parts, each part incapable of support-
ing a large army for any length of time.
The capture of Atlanta must, therefore, give new hope to the country
of the speedy termination of the Rebellion. Grant will be able to act
with greater decision than ever. If Johnston can be kept from reinforcing
Lee, Lee must soon fight under great disadvantage, or retreat with the
danger of annihilation. (9)
2509 - L. July 27; ed:2/1 - Generals Lee and Johnston are working hand in
hand to defeat Sherman. Johnston already has falien back from Chattanooga
to get in position to be reinforced hy Lee, who has also sent off large
numbers to defeat Sherman in Georgia. It seems the South has suddenly de-
cided to invade such northern states as Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.
"This magnificent scheme hatched in Baltimore, will undoubtedly succeed,
unless General Grant concludes to modify it. We shall see what we shall
see," (5)
2510 - L Aug. 1: 1/1 - In a letter to the editor, P. says: In a camp near
Atlanta, several boys were collected around a house where there were sev-
eral fine-lonking young women. One of them remarked "You'ns don't
fight we'ns fair. Hooker takes his regiment and goes around and fight
we'ns end ways." They do not approve of Shermans flanking operations.
The Rebels announce they will hold Atlanta till the last; and if they
are finally driven out, they will leave it in ashes. -
Major General McPherson, who was killed in the early part of the engage-
ments, was a brave, gallant, and efficient officer, and commanded the re-
spect of all who knew him. "The loss of such an officer in such a time as
this is a great loss and keenly felt. We hope to be in Atlanta soon." (15)
2511 - L. Aug. 2:2/4, 5 - In a letter to the editor, "Ceylon," in a camp five
miles north of Atlanta, says: During the entire campaign of the advance
toward Atlanta, we had not been charged by the enemy and had about con-
cluded that we never would be when a shower of balls came whizzing over
our heads, followed by savage yells. "The enemy massed in heavy columns
and tried to break our lines; but Hooker thundered away with heavy artillery
and drove the enemy back in confusion. Night came, leaving the field in our
possession with satisfactory results, our losses being small; but the ground
was literally covered with dead Rebels, among them many officers. The
entire Rebel loss will exceed 2,000. Our loss will scarcely exceed 200
killed and wounded. -
"We expect to reach Atlanta soon." (23)

"The conduct of those troops to whom was assigned the glorious duty of
carrying the enemy's position was as disgraceful as it proved disastrous
to themselves." - - (11)
2513 - L. Aug. 12; ed:2/1 - Attention of the nation is directed toward
Mobile, Ala. Word from that city warns us that Mobile is in greater dan-
ger now than at any time during the war. The capture of Mobile will have
important bearing on affairs in Alabama. Its possession will give us the
navigation of the Alabama river as far as Montgomery, and will enable
Sherman to advance to Alabama and Georgia. -
"On the whole, the speedy fall of Mobile is predicted, if Admiral
Farragut and General Asbothano allowed to indulge their fighting propen-
sities." (12)
2514 - L. Aug. 15; ed:2/2 - News received at Washington gives assurance
that things are progressing favorably in Mobile. Fort Morgan, with 132
guns, is still holding Mobile, but is in danger due to her weak defences
on the east.
It is certain that the capture of Mobile will result in splitting the
Confederacy once more. - (7)
2516 - L. Aug. 31; ed:2/1 - The capture of Fort Morgan is confirmed. This
gives us the key to Mobile harbor, which is a fitting climax to the three
weeks' operations of Farragut.
"As its result we have released our blockading squadron from duty and
sent them to other points, to save our commerce from destruction." (5)
2517 - L. Sept. 6; ed;2/2 - The possession of Atlanta by Sherman is a great
victory for Union forces and cannot be too highly estimated. His next
victory will undoubtedly be the state of Georgia, leaving the two Carolinas.
and southern Virginia confined to the Rebellion. -
"The country is grateful to Sherman for his great triumph, which comes at
an opportune time and brushes away the miasmas that arose in Chicago and
spread all over the land. The sunlight is again shining and the Republic
is sure to triumph." (6)
2518 - L. Sept. 16; ed:2/3 - Evidences are accumulating to show that “...
General Lee is massing as many troops as he can command to make an attack
upon General Grant, and, by defeating Grant, to assist McClellan's politi-sº
cal ambitions. - -- .
The Richmond EXAMINER of the 8th says: "Military success, then, will not
retain Lincoln in his seat. The influence of the South - more powerful in
the shock of battle than when throwing her minority vote in an electoral
college - will be cast in favor of McClellan by this indirect yet effi-
cacious means." - (4)

2519 - L. Sept. 29; ed: 2/1 - Amid all the victories over which the North is
exulting, there is a constant looking forward to the prospective capture
of Richmond. At present every indication points to its speedy capture.
Sherman will no doubt send two corps of his army to Lynchburg by way of
Knoxville. This would enable the combined forces of Sherman and Sheridan,
on both sides of Richmond, to move down on the city "like an avalanche from
the mountain sides."
"Lee will make a desperate effort to avoid impending ruin in Virginia,
but it is written in the decrees of God." (13)
2520 - L. Sept. 29; ed:2/2 - Latest reports represent great agitation in
the Rebel lines in front of Grant. Lee is putting forth every effort to
check Sheridan's men as they advance toward Lynchburg, but he may find
Grant suddenly swooping down upon Danville or making some other unexpected
In OVe.
"The signs are hopeful in the North. Dismay reigns in rebeldom." (6)
2521 - L Oct. 10; ed: 2/1 - When McClellan was before the committee on the
conduct of the war, he was asked where he was on the day of the battle of
Malvern Hill. He replied, "I cannot remember."
"The reason he could not remember is because he left the field and
spent the day enjoying himself in a gunboat several miles away; and yet
such a soldier is running for the office of President. Mac knew that his
admission of having left the field and retired to a gunboat would brand
him as a coward, and he therefore told a deliberate falsehood to get him-
self out of his unpleasant predicament." (4)
2522 - L Dec. 14; ed: 2/2 - The battle at Savanrah has not been fought ac-
cording to latest reports, but Sherman is steadily advancing and will soon
strike the first blow. The Southern press, "from which accounts of his
movements are gained, is a distorting medium, and news is almost worthless.
We shall have news from Sherman himself in a few days, of this grand march
through the heart of the Confederacy." (2)
2523 - L Dec. 15:3/2 - In a letter to the editor, T. M. Davidson, a re-
leased prisoner says, many things regarding his experience in the Southern
Confederacy. Of special interest is his description of the fortifications
of Savannah and the condition of that city. He says: "The river at Fort
Jackson is lined with thirty-six huge siege guns. The river is blocked with
heavy timbers leaving just enough room for a boat to pass. Just above this
entrance are two ironclads, well manned, and above these are torpedoes.
Their location is known, by the sharp pointed projection of a log about
six inches from the surface. No man could be seen at, or near the forti-
fication, earth works being thrown up around the guns for the men's pro-
tection. These guns, together with obstructions in the river, are intended
to crush anything that may come up but offer little resistance from a land
force from the direction of Savannah. Sherman will have little difficulty

at this point. The swamps will impede his progress more than anything
else. The force at Savannah is composed of old men, little boys and
crippled officers. Business of all kinds in the city is stopped, re- -
minding us of Sunday." - - - - - (9)
2524 - L Dec. 16; ed: 2/1 - Yesterday's dispatches prove without a
doubt that Sherman is in full possession of Savannah. His glorious
movement has met with the most complete and triumphant success. He has
moved through the very heart of the Confederacy, proving its hollowness
and weakness. He has cut the Rebellion completely in two by the entire
destruction of its railroad system, and has established himself on the
Atlantic with a convenient base for operating against Charleston, and
within easy communication with Grant. These are the grand results of
the expedition and all this was achieved without almost any loss of
life, or ammunition.
"Let us all unite in the north and "Hurrah for Sherman and his gallant
soldiers.'" (9)
2525 - L. Dec. 19; ed: 2/1, 2 - "Never before has the war been prosecuted
with such terrible efficiency as at present, and never before have the
prospects of a sure and speedy triumph of our cause been brighter.
Within the last few days the events that have occurred point to the suc-
cess of the Union forces... the Confederacy has been literally split to
fragments. The first important event was destruction of the Weldon
railroad, which connected Richmond and Lee's army with the South.
Further south, valuable commissaries have been destroyed, together with
a million dollars worth of rebel supplies. The most brilliant of the
glorious successes is the one in which that gallant veteran, Thomas, is
still winning in front of Nashville. Five thousand prisoners have been
taken and thirty-nine pieces of artillery. Such is the inspiring cata-
logue of Union successes of the last few days. The news of the last
week shows that only a few weak garrisons are held by the rebel forces,
which will soon be in the hands cf our Union Generals." (24)
2526 - L. Dec. 19; ed:2/2 - Official dispatches announce the capture of
Fort McAllister, a strong and important earthwork at the mouth of the
Ogeechee river.
But we need not wait for the capture of Savannah to rejoice over the
success of Sherman's movement. The object of that movement--to disem-
bowel the Confederacy by a destructive march from Atlanta to the Atlantic,
is already gained. Let us thank God that the army is in safety at the
sea-board. (5)
2527 - L Dec. 27; ed: 2/1 - General Sherman is sure that he will capture
Savannah. Richmond papers have given up Savannah, and make little of
this triumph. The Richmond and Savannah papers had Sherman's army ruined
many times, but "the operation seems to have agreed with our General and
our veterans. Everything goes to prove that this grand anabasis of
Sherman's is the most successful movement of the war." . . . (6)

2528 - H Dec. 27; ed:2/2 - "It was a glorious morning start of a "merry
Christmas, ' to hear of the capture of Savannah.... We hope Porter and
Butler can lay a New Year gift of Wilmington upon the altar of liber-
ties.... It was hoped that the investment of Savannah meant a com-
plete hemming in of Hardee's army.... It became a question of whether
he should save his men and give us the stores, or run the risk of
losing both. Hardee decided wisely, for his men could not be re-
placed, while supplies might be."
2529 - H Dec. 27:2/3 - In a letter to the editor, "P. F. Y.," on Dec.
15, writes about the 107th regiment's position and other army news.
He says: "At Deveaux Neck, S. W., we have Hammer's battery posted
within 3/4 of a mile of the Charleston and Savannah railroad---Both
cities must fall ere long, and this rebellion will soon be a thing of

Captain Pruff to a major of the 125th regiment. -
2553 - L. Mar. 4; ed:4/2 - U. S. Grant has been nominated lieutenant
general by Lincoln. If General Grant can infuse "the same brilliant
genius into the future operations of all our armies as he has exhibited,
the country may be congratulated."
2554 - L. Mar. 15: 1/3 - Captain S. K. Williams, late of the 2nd Ohio
cavalry, was dismissed from the service on a charge preferred by a
fellow officer, for hanging some guerrillas in Kentucky. After his
dismissal he secured a trial before the military commission in this
city, of which General Rickets is president. He has just been honor-
ably acquitted by this commission, restored to the army, and pro-
moted to the rank of major in the invalid corps.
2555 - L. Mar. 28; ed:2/1 - Major Generals Sykes, French, and Newton,
have been shelved from the army. Four more major generals.
"If any of them have any performance in them, let them take a posi-
tion in some place where the responsibility of their actions will not
upset the plan of the campaign."

2559 - L June 16; ed: 2/1 - The stubborn audacity with which Grant has

"Admitting that Grant's army has fought as it never fought before,
the WHIG makes merry over the idea that Grant is intent on destroying

2560 - L June 25; ed: 2/1 - The secessionists, traitors, and "Copper-
heads" of our large cities have a way of representing General Grant
which must be satisfactory to the Rebels. One would suppose, to read

"We have reason to believe that Cox would be speedily and intensely
disgusted, and would return to his hearth and home a different, wiser

2567 - L Apr. 13; ed:2/1 - Long of Cincinnati in a speech which "made
Congress boil" said in part: "I believe that there are but two alterna-

the South or their complete extermination as a people, and of these
alternatives I prefer the former."
LEADER:
"We do not regard it worthwhile to show how utterly illogical and
treasonable the speech of Long's is. It will sting itself to death, and
the nation will only be strengthened when once all northern rebels
unite with their brethren of the South in favor of recognizing Southern
Independence." (12)
2568 - L June 1; ed: 2/1 - On May 23, Leach of the Rebel house of repre-
sentatives introduced a series of resolutions on the subject of peace.
The plan provides that the states propose an armistice of 90 days, dur-
ing which time they would consult with peace making powers of the North.
"Evidently General Grant's strategy is calculated to produce a peace
party in Richmond." (4)
2569 - L June 25; ed: 2/1 - However much we may disagree with the purposes
of the peace men, however untenable in practice their positions may be,
there is something in their efforts that presents a tangible point of
opposition. The issue is "Shall the war be stopped, the Union be di-
vided, our armies withdrawn, the Confederacy recognized, and slavery re-
established, or shall it be prosecuted with the power and might of a
great nation until our nationality is vindicated, and the flag is float-
ing over every foot of the republic."

"The people who are making all the sacrifices are not content to ac-
cept such a peace as the sniveling, cowardly, pro-slavery Copperhead of
the North would like to have. Away with such peace." (9)

loyal, will grow more thoughtful when he reals that two distinguished
citizens, one an officer in the Union army, have had free access to the
Rebel capital, have been kindly received by the Rebel chief, have freely: ...
conversed with him on the prospect of peace, and have returned to com-
municate to the President the results of the interview. -
Men of high standing in the Confederacy have asked for an inter-
view with our government looking forward to negotiating for peace. The
object of the negotiations may have been to influence the Chicago con-
vention, or may have been the desire of the Rebels to abandon their use-
less struggle. If Rebels will plant themselves on a Democratic plat-
form of "Free Speech, Free Labor, Free Men," the North will sustain
them. The Democratic party wants peace at any cost. -
"The 'Union and Liberty' are not to stand in the way of this achieve-
ment." (13)
2571 - L. July 26; ed: 2/1 - The conditions upon which it is possible to .
establish peace between the North and South are forming the subject of
discussion throughout the North, and we are not alarmed that the sub-
ject of peace is to be agitated. - - - - . .
Democrats seem to be willing to take issue with Lincoln and the Union
on the subject of the conditions of peace. Lincoln demands that the
Rebels shall concede the territorial irtegrity of the Union and the
abandonment of slavery which is not indispensable, but is a hot bed for . . .
future Rebellions and revolutions. People of the North realize that if
slavery is not destroyed, it will endanger the future.
"Let the people therefore be on their guard, against rebellion,
treason, and terrible wars again. There is no security except in a
Peace whose conditions are the territorial integrity of the whole Union
and the abandonment of slavery." (20)
2572 - L. July 27; ed:2/1 - The South in proposing new peace plans wants
to keep slavery, and be allowed to add Mexico to the present bounds of
slavery. Northerners will not consent to such terms, their desire being
to do away with slavery. - -
"To ask the people of the north to consent to geographical boundary . . .
lines which shall surrender one foot of territory now in the possession
of our armies is to insult the dignity and power of this Free Republic
of the North. No political party, once in power, would concede such
demands. On the other hand re-union with slavery is quite intolerable."

such as it never cunceived.
"With Peace and Union will come many blessings, and we are for such
peace as this, but believe it only attainable through the unconditional
submission of the rebels to the two conditions named." (9)
2574 - L Aug. 10; ed: 2/1 - Political parties of the North think that
peace will be declared within the year. Now the question arises, "Shall
there be Peace as the North wants or Peace as the South wants?"
"If Lincoln is re-elected, a Peace worthy of the sacrifices of our
soldiers and of the people, will be consummated." (4)
2575 - L. Aug. 16; ed: 2/1 - The Democratic party recommends an armis-
tice for at least six months. "Copperheads" claim that the Union inen
and the administration do not want peace, but desire disunion, and are
only fighting for boundary lines. This is utterly false. Those who have
supported the government with men and money, and who have fathers, sons,
and brothers in the ranks of the Union army really desire peace. Those
who have opposed the war from the first, and have stayed at home and
made money naturally oppose an armistice, though they are always whin-
ing and complaining about the cruel war and about peace.
"We therefore say, that the men and women who most need Peace are in
the Union Party. They know what war costs, and stand ready at the
earliest moment, to restore Peace, Liberty and Union to the whole -
country." (16)
2576 - L. Aug. 18:2/3, 4 - In a letter to the editor, "Celon" expresses
very accurately the feeling our army has toward peace grumblers. He
says: "Our blood has often boiled with indignation at the actions of
these would-be men but of late our anger has turned to pity, and our
sympathies for them prompt us to give them some advice: As you have
not the heart to fight, do not talk so much. The continual spouting
about constitutional rights, personal safety, etc., prove that you only
have a place for brains."
The soldier dies in hope of victory, and the bliss of such dying
compensates for a life of suffering. Not so with you who only think of
peace at any price. (15)
2577 - I, Aug. 20; ed:2/1 - Peace is discussed on every hand, but it has
been said that the government has put obstacles in the way of restoring
peace, which will prevent the reconstruction of the Union as long as the
present administration is in power. The abandonment of slavery as
advocated by Lincoln will, it has been said, delay peace because the
Rebels do not agree that slavery should be abolished.
"It would certainly be great misfortune if the vital power of
slavery is not extinguished by the war. We have always thought that its
extinction is necessary to our future peace, and when peace comes, we
greatly prefer that peace and Union which comes from Lincoln to that -
which might come from some other source." (12)

2578 - L Aug. 20; ed: 2/2 - Jeff Davis, thinks that the South is an in-
dependent power, ard that peace can come only by separation. Ile says º
the South is fighting solely for independence, and attaches no special . . . .
interest to slavery, which is evidence that Rebel leaders are not ". . .
ready to surrender in favor of peace. - - - - - - -
The revelations made by this interview must effectually stop the
mouths of the brawling peace men who insist that the only obstacle in
the way of peace is the Government at Washington. - (6)
2579 - L. Aug. 22; ed: 2/1 - The American people are so tired of war
that they are liable to accept terms of peace which will shift burdens
and desolations to their children. No one denies that slavery is the
source of all war woes and is prolo.jging the war. -
"With slavery in a restored Union there could be no permanent peace
with jealousies of North and South there would be constant danger of
other ruptures and finally, of war again. The only condition of a -
permanent future is the destruction of slavery." (11)
2580 - L. Aug. 22; ed: 2/2 - The Democratic party wants peace to come
by an armistice and convention of the states, which means the restor-
ation of the government on Rebel terms. - - --
If "peace-at-any-price men" obtain mastery at the Chicago convention,
there will be the issue of peace or war. If peace is preferred to .
restoration of the Union, there would be no doubt that peace would come
under Democratic rule. Democrats, however, cannot expect success by
juggling and deceit, and must explain what is meant by "armistice" and
"convention." - - (8)
2581 - L. Aug. 29; ed: 2/2 - We are not in favor of the government pro-
posing an armistice, but favor "continuation of the war till the slave-
holders are subdued and compelled to submit to the laws of the country."
- (7)
2582 - L. Sept. 3; ed:2/1 - "The proposition made at Chicago, to have a
convention of all the states, is surrounded by so many difficulties so
long as the organized power of the rebellion continues to exist that
the Democratic press has almost failed to discuss its feasibility."
The Rebels give no indication that they are ready to accept peace
at the sacrifice of their independence. There can be no such thing as
treating for peace in earnest "until every hostile soldier shall have
been withdrawn from our soil, and every hostile ship from our waters."
"One chance remains, and this is to fight through. We have gone
beyond the midnight of these crucial times, and the shortest road to
light is forward, through whatever light remains. To go forward is
pºssible and ends in light. To go backward ends in darkness impenetra-
ble." (18)

2583 - L. Sept. 8; ed: 2/2 - Granting of an armistice by the government
would only result in strengthening the Rebels for renewal of war.
Nothing but the most degrading self-abasement of the North will avail
to make an armistice result in peace.
"Let everyone remember that so long as there is no official declara-
tion from the rebels that they are ready to consent to the restoration
of the Union, an armistice would simply result in their independence." ---
- - (4)
2584 - L. Oct. 13; ed:2/1 - Some people of the North are taught to think
that the only obstacle in the way of a speedy peace is the unwilling-
ness of Lincoln to compromise in such a way that the Rebels will be
induced to return.
"Possibly Jeff Davis, after being driven to the extremity of despair,
and seeing his power about to pass away, woull agree to be conciliated
and live with his friends; but in the name of our Republic, in the
name of our murdered countrymen whose bones lie bleaching in every -
Southern State, in the name of the poor white men of the South and the
cruelly wronged black race, by all that is dear and noble and sacred
in a great people, we protest against compromise and conciliation, and
demand that the traitors, and murderers, shall be drawn and quartered,
hung and shot, and the integrity of the Republic restored." (17)
2585 - L Oct. 17; ed: 2/2 - Alexander Stephens of Georgia is said to
favor a peace which will recognize the "Sovereignty of the States,"
also to be in favor of a convention of states.
"This is very ingenious. Stephens favors having the North admit the
very principle against which we have contended, the 'sovereign right'
of a state to secede whenever she sees fit. This doctrine has been the
cause of all our woes. The hel lish work of leaders in the South was
done under the guise of State Sovereignty, the right of which Stephens
wishes to see granted by a convention of States." - (4)
and
2586 - L. Oct. 19, ed:2/1 - Alexander H. Stephens thinks a convention
of states would be a gocq thing, provided the Confederacy is first
recognized as an independent power. Nor would he be willing to leave
the questions in dispute to the absolute decision of such a body.
This is a political trick. Stephens regards the peace movement in
the North as "part of the fruits" of the resolutions passed by the
Georgia legislature that states are sovereign powers and have the right
to secede when they see fit.
"Mr. Stephens might as well give up his ideas of new Confederacies
that shall embrace the north-west. The north-west-stands by the whole
Union in all its integrity and will fight to the bitter end to main-
tain it." - (11)

2588 - L Nov. 18; ed: 2/1 - General Butler thinks "the olive branch
of peace" should be extended to the Rebels, so that they may choose be- -
tween submission to the constitution and years of unrelenting war,
only to end finally in their utter ruin and annihilation.
"If the Rebels again refuse to accept the proffered terms of peace,
they must take the terrible consequences of unpitying war." (15)
2589 - L Dec. 2; ed: 2/1 - In the discussion of peace found in the
Rebel press, both North and South, much is said about "the cruelty of . ,
proposing terms of peace to the Rebels which may 'wound their pride' . . ."
or bring 'disgrace upon their escutcheons.'"
"The absurdity of such talk must be evident to everybody. After
drenching the land in blood and slaughtering immense numbers of our
people, they ask that they shall not be treated as the criminals and ... ."
traitors they are, but so as not to wound their tender susceptibilities." - .

felt in the Rebel capital. One result is the resolution offered by McCullen
of Virginia for the appointment of commissioners to treat for peace. . . . . .
"The very fact of its resolution, by a member who has never before been … .

success of the Rebellion." - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - (7)

Lincoln's address to Congress. He agreed with the views of Lincoln . . .
regarding the termination of the war, criticized the sentiment of some … .
members of Congress who wish to "subjugate" the South, and concluded
his remarks with this significant statement:
"In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say, that

"Possibly time will work a cure in these over-sensitive rebels." (4)
2593 - L Apr. 2; ed: 2/1 - Stories of Jeff Davis prisoners who have es-
caped from their cruel tormentors or have been exchanged, all prove
that the most barbarous treatment has been suffered by them.
"May a speedy delivery come to our men in their hands and a right-
eous retribution upon the heads of all rebels." (12)

at Fort Pillow. "And yet there are some cowardly traitors to their
country who wish to capitulate to the armed barbarism of the South." (6)
2595 - L Apr. 21; ed:2/1 - Congress has grown indignant about the mas-
sacre at Fort Pillow and is anxious to have our soldiers respected.
"Congress has done itself no credit in the manner in which it has
been dealing with our black soldiers. Will they, now that the indig-
nant inquisition is begun, not look into this injustice now being done
to the black soldiers?" (5)
2596 - L Apr. 26; ed:2/2 - Davis has a reputation of unbending obstinacy
and hauteur; but that is for his friends. He is polite and reasonable
when the public enemy commands him, at his peril, to eat his own words
and come down from his high horse. "Davis has not hanged General
Butler as he threatened to do, but found himself compelled to negotiate
with him for the exchange of prisoners." (5)

these photographs and become convinced. - -
"The value of these photographs consists in the silent, mournful,
but irrefragible witness they bear to the tales of rebel cruelty." . . (12)
2601 - L June 7:4/4 - In a letter to the editor, Dr. E. Wallace sends
four photographs showing the cruelty of Rebels to Union soldiers. Dr.
Wallace says that twice he has been to the U. S. general hospital, di-
vision No. 1, at Annapolis, Md., and has witnessed cases of cruelty
that brought tears to his eyes. Ile says: "Show these pictures far and
wide, for they speak the truth and nothing but the truth - though but -
a small part of the truth." (5)
2602 - L June 8; ed: 2/4 - The Cincinnati ENQUIRER scoffs at the stories
and pictures which have been circulated of cruel treatment received by
Union prisoners at the hands of the Rebels.
"In this sad and awful spectacle of miseries unparalleled in the
story of mankind, the ENQUIRER - devoted as ever to the slave aristo-
cracy - finds only fit matter for ridicule and ribaldry." (5)

through Cleveland streets yesterdny. (2)
2604 - L July 23:2/2 - In a letter to the editor, an officer in a Macon,
Georgia prison tells of conditions there. He says that although they
receive some meat, the bread rations have been cut, and that without
money many will suffer. They are encamped in a grove, and the cold
night air from the dew and the cold is making many of the men ill.
"I am almost naked - no hat, no coat, or drawers; pants 'seatless' and - -
boots on last 'tour of duty.'" (4)
2605 - L. Aug. 11; ed: 2/1 - The reasons why so many thousands of prisoners
are held by the Rebels and by the Union are because the authorities on
both sides cannot agree as to the number of paroled and exchanged
prisoners; also to the recognition by Rebel authorities of Negro soldiers
as prisoners of war. - -
Prisoners taken by the Rebels are treated poorly, being half starved
and lacking medical care, while prisoners taken by the North are treated
just the opposite. - -
"The duty of the government is that of retaliation, until every man. .
wearing the uniform of an American soldier is respected." (6)

They are exposed to the terrific heat of the sun by day, and the damp-
ness of the dew by night. Many of them are suffering from disease and
some even lose their minds. Others go across the "dead line" and beg
to be shot to end their misery.
This cruel policy has heen executed by the Rebels to compel the
government to accede to their terms of exchange.
"Why do not the friends of the chivalry here in the North lay before
their readers a statement of the cruel ties practiced upon our soldiers,
and seize every opportunity to declaim against any apparent severity
towards rebel prisoners in the North, while they have not a manly word
of condemnation for the way cur brave boys are murdered in the South."

Lieut. John Cutter, from a military prison in Charleston, S. C., stat-
ing that he was taken prisoner by the Rebels July 22. (2)
2608 - L Sept. 9; ed: 2/1 - The Rebel Commissioner Ould professes to be
affected by the condition of the Union soldiers held in the South, and
offers to make an exchange. But he makes no concessions on the sub-
ject of Negro soldiers.
General Butler refuses to exchange "until every man dressed in the
uniform of a United States soldier shall be recognized and treated as
a soldier, not as one to be sold into slavery.
The Rebels at present treat all colored soldiers as runaway slaves.
All officers of colored regiments, by an order from Jeff Davis which
has not yet been repealed, are delivered over to the state authorities
to be treated as criminals subject to death.
The position of Butler is sustained by every principle of national
and municipal law.
"Their sºameful abuse of our men in Georgia, over which Ould af-
fects to shed tears, has been solely for the purpose of compelling our
government to barter away its honor and its faith which it pledged to
every black man on entering the Army." (17)
2609 - L Nov. 14; ed:2/2 - "When history with her impartial pen, re-
cites the story of these times she will chronicle the treatment which
has been bestowed upon the Union and rebel prisoners in the North and
South." -
Cnristian care has been shown to Rebel prisoners taken by the North,
but just the opposite treatment was accorded to the Union prisoners .
taken by the South. They were starved, robbed, confined in a small
crowded disinal quarters, and tortured to their graves.
"Jeff Davis cannot deny these facts. History will prove where the
guilt of cruelty lies." (11)
2610 - H Nov. 25: 1/4 - W. L. Selden of Mayfield, member of Co. I, of

2611 - L Nov. 28; ed:2/2 - The report of the exchange of prisoners at
Savannah is full of "terrible interest." The barbarous cruel ties of
the Rebels toward Union soldiers are fully confirmed from independent
and indisputable sources. Ancther fact established is that the Rebel
authorities have made the Union soldiers believe that they have been
cruelly abandoned by their government. - -
"By operating upon them in this way, large numbers have been induced
to join the rebel forces in order to escape the horrors of confinement
in those hells which rebels call prisons. The return of those already
exchanged, will create deepest indignation among the people, and a just
sense of the barbarous character of the enemy with which we are fight-
ing." - - - - (5)
2612 - L Dec. 13; ed: 2/1 - Nothing can exceed the atrocities of the
Rebel officers toward the Union soldiers. They will forever be branded
as "the basest of all creatures permitted to live. The cruel ties in-
flicted are worthy of the ingenuity of friends, and such as a Northern
Freeman would not inflict upon a dog. In the midst of these cruelties,
rebel recruiting officers attempted to bribe Union prisoners into rebel
service and in many instances succeeded, because of the fact that these
prisoners were eager to be released from rebel prisons. Thank God the
exchange of prisoners is still going on and some may yet be saved who
would otherwise die in Southern prisons." (5)

Governor Brough said: "You have been in a school and under a dis-
cipline which has taught you many things. You have learned one thing
amid the carnage of battle - that there are but two alternatives left

turned from Washington yesterlay by train. They were given breakfast
at Wheeler and Russell's dining hall, where they were welcomed by Mayor
Senter on behalf of the city. He said in part:
"It is with feelings of pride commingled with deep sorrow that I, on
behalf of our city and the military committee welcome you, after your
years of hardships in the field, to your return to peaceful life.
"But my pride is checked in its exultation as I look upon your
meagre ranks and sorrow saddens my heart.
"Where are those thousand brave and stalwart men who went forth for
their country's peace? Alas! Bones whitening on vast battlefields,
unmarked mounds in devastated regions, and leathsome prison houses only

"Thank God you, few as you are, have been spared - spared, not mere-

country, but for the higher purpose of reminding us continually, by

the streets with women of doubtful reputations will be ordered dismissed
if they continue. (2)
2654 - L Apr. 23; ed:2/1 - Soldiers who are fighting for liberty and
the Union are heroes. But a soldier drunk, profane and debauched, is
neither a hero, nor has he the admiration of the people.
"Let the soldier understand that while a generous people admire his
valor, and applaud his devotion to the flag, they do not admire his dis- .
sipation, profanity, or insults, while at home on furlough." - - (6)
2655 - L Apr. 30; ed:2/1 - The Senate Bill equalizing the pay of white
and colored troops has hung fire in the House so long that the Senate
has adopted it as an amendment to the army appropriation bill.
"The government owes equal pay and protection to all its soldiers,
and no discrimination should be made against men who have volunteered
in face of certain death if captured, to fight the battles of the govern-
ment which has denied to them the rights of citizenship under it." (7)

ing 25,000 in camp and field. - (G)
2658 - L. May 23; ed: 1/1 - Many Northern papers have thrown discourage-
ment before the people, such as in saying that one-third of Grant's
army has been destroyed. "The true facts" are that General Grant ac-
tually received reinforcements which more than make up for his losses.
"Instead of discouragement we have the best reason to feel cheered
with the successes of our armies thus far." (11)
2659 - L. May 23:3/2 - The Government has ordered a double inspection of
the slightly wounded and the arrest by the provost guard of all who are

2661 - L May 26; ed: 2/2 - The Elyria Democrats and the Elyria people
are excited over the transfer of the Oberl in company from the Elyria
battalion into the 150th regiment. They have said some ridiculous
things in regard to this. In the death of a member of the Elyria com-
pany, the Democrats said he would not have died "if the original assign-
ment of the company had not been disturbed."
"It is somewhat difficult to discover the logic or fairness in a re-
mark like this." (4)
2662 - L June 2:4/4 - The 12th regiment under Col. Oliver H. Payne,
which left Cleveland one year ago, has sustained itself nobly in every

regiment, O. N. G., Fort Lincoln, says: "The regiment is encamped

Grant. He says nearby is the Bladensburg dueling grounds. Company H -
has been removed from Bunker hill to this spot." - (11)
2667 - L June 15; ed: 2/3 - The Richmond WHIG writes that the people at
home are gossiping about the drunkenness of Generals "Blank and Dash."
It seems that it is the habit of both these distinguished officers
to get drunk whenever they can procure the liquor, which they always
contrive to do on the eve of an important engagement.
"The public, seldom willing to turn a deaf ear to slanders of any
kind, seems, we regret to observe, to find a special charm in the ac-
cusations against military men." - (11)

2670 - L. July 9:4/3 - In a letter to the editor, Capt. A. A. Stafford
explains the Oberlin company's transfer to the 15th O. N. G. by saying
that the editor of the Elyria DEMOCRAT charges the officers of Co. A
with quiet "trickery" regarding the transfer, and claims that members -
of the company tried to have the Elyria and Oberlin companies united with
Cleveland, but conditions being unfavorable, it was suggested that the
company be transferred to the 150th.
"Our company was ordered to Elyria and the DEMOCRAT accused us of
"trickery" during our week's stay and said we were guilty of planning
a consolidation with Cleveland after agreeing to go to the 13th. I
called upon the editor, asked him to name one instance where we resort-
ed to trickery, but he failed to do so.
"Leaving Elyria the last of the week I expected to return, but found
the transfer had been made and reported the news to Maj. H. C. Laundon.
"The members of our company are very grateful for the kindness shown
us by the people of Elyria and they passed resolutions to that effect.

the order comes to draw rations, which always causes a commotion.
"The Commissary Sergeant is a very popular man in the Regiment as
long as he has a good supply of rations. "Our hearts are sad as June

bravery in the field and fidelity to the Union at the ballot box will
win the most glorious triumph that history has ever recorded, for the
Country and Liberty." (8)

ger in Chapin's hall last evening was an enthusiastic and brilliant

ery, and gave an outline of the adventures of himself and his companions,
of their journey into Rebel territory, the seizure of a railroad tra in
and an extraordinary run of 65 miles an hour to escape their pursuers,
the break-down of the train, and their capture, all of which formed one
of the most daring and thrilling narratives of suffering and trial ever
recorded in history.

A correspondent asks why the government does not put transportation
of medical supplies into the hands of the sanitary commission, if the

deserves the indignation of all men. - - (4)
2712 - L. July 6:2/3 - Patriotic citizens who contributed money to buy
onions and other vegetables for soldiers to combat scurvy, prevalent a-
mong them will be pleased to know that their contributions came in on
the transport BELVIDERE in large quantities.
The following is a list of articles placed on board: Four hundred bar-
rels of onions; 300 barrels of turnips; 21 barrels of beets; 50 boxes of
lemons, and 7,000 to 10,000 heads of cabbage. (4)
2713 - L. July 11; ed: 2/1 - "An opportunity for patriotic and benevolent
labor is opened up by the Christian commission, which no robust student or
minister who can spare the time, should neglect." - -
A great deal of work is yet to be done and many more men are needed to
carry on the work of ministering to soldiers on the battle field, and in

2714 - L July 15; ed:2/3 - An urgent appeal is sent out for arm-slings for

"We respectfully commend this work to the ladies Soldiers' Aid Society
of this city, and like associations throughout the nation." (3)
2715 - L July 19; ed: 2/1 - Governor Brough appeals to the Soldiers' Aid
societies of northern Ohio to send supplies to General Barlow at Columbus
for sick and wounded soldiers at the front. -
"Such noble Charity has its own reward, and every one who contributes a
little can feel that he has been instrumental in saving a life."
The governor of Ohio has also asked boys and gills to pick blackberries
for the aid societies. (4)
2716 - L. July 29; ed:4/2 - The Soldiers' home, located on the Columbus
railroad pier overlooking the lake, is a haven of rest and comfort for
wounded and war-weary men. The home is provided and kept open by the ladies
of the Soldiers' Aid society, "which deepens our admiration for the steady
loyalty with which the ladies of the Aid Society persevere in their noble
work."
For those who have suffered literally nothing in this war for the Union
and free institutions, "it is well... to stand at the couch of a wounded
soldier as he writhes in anguish, and to ask ourselves whether, through any
miserable cowardice at home, or from any meaner motives, the great cause
in which so many of our brave men have died, or suffered worse than death,

of as many soldiers as possible. The writer says that the disease of
diarrhoea, which many have, if not checked, becomes serious and causes
much suffering. It can be cured by the use of blackberries in some
form. Since there is an abundance of this fruit, the people are asked
to gather and make juice of them, as they have a health-giving quality
not found in other fruit. The letter adds that everyone should be will-
ing and anxious to do this small thing for our loyal and suffering
soldiers. (14)
2718 - L Aug. 2; ed:2/2 - "It is an indisputable fact that there has
never been a war in which so much care has been taken of the sick and
wounded soldiers, as by the people of the North during this lamented
rebellion."
Europe is spending a great deal of time on the subject of how to care
for the sick and wounded soldiers, and has arranged to hold a confer-
ence in Geneva, Switzerland, to consider some vital points. If adopted,
they will mitigate the horrors of war. (6)
2719 - H Aug. 5:4/2 - In a letter to the editor, F. W. Bingham writes
regarding some of the needs of our soldiers and gives suggestions as
to what kinds of food to send. He says: "The suggestions are designed-
ly limited to certain articles, with the hope that attention will be
directed to their preparation while the material can be obtained." (8)
2720 - L Aug. 30; ed:2/1, 3 - On a recent journey to Washington, we
visited the hospital in Armory Square in charge of Dr. D. W. Bliss,
formerly of this city. A complete survey of the whole place was made,
and we found that every convenience and care that could be thought of
was administered to the wounded soldiers. Volunteer nurses and many
ladies of refinement are giving their services and their time to care
for these wounded, with no thought of compensation but the gratitude of
the patients.
"These noble women, some of them girls, perform their duties in a
quiet manner..."
The general appearance of cheerfulness that prevails in all the wards
is a most refreshing feature. A special diet, served to those whose
appetites require something different from the ordinary diet, is pur-
chased from a fund made up from the proceeds of the sale of swill, bones,
and other garbage, producing $40 a month. The sutler's tax of $120 a
month and the pay of 18 nurses, generously given to the fund in addition
to the government allowance, enables Dr. Bliss to "grant the request of
any sick or wounded soldier for any little articles of luxury he may ask
for.
"We, the people of the North, may well feel proud of our hospitals
if Armory Square is a sample of them." (52)

dissipation. It is a fact that tobacco affords more solace and comfort
to those who are in the habit "of using it," than anything else money
can buy; and it is not as likely to create sickness as some seem to
think.
"We have no word of commendation for the habit, and think it filthy
and unnecessary, and one that young men should avoid. However these
soldiers in camp and field who have used tobacco, crave it, and it
should be furnished them if it gives the least amount of comfort to
their tedious lives." (6)

pleasure the receipt of $4.58, the proceeds of a fair held by little
girls for the benefit of the Sanitary commission. - (2)

the U. S. military hospital with a bell for the hospital chapel. (1)
2724 - L Oct. 3:4/6 - The Christian commission held a meeting in Old
Stone church today. Reverend Wolcott, Ohio delegate in the army of the
Cumberland, gave a report of his experiences in the South, details
concerning the care of the sick and wounded soldiers, and reflections
suggested by his visit and work in the armies of Georgia.
The most intelesting part of Reverend Mr. Wolcott's address was his
testimony to the hopeful condition of the Negroes in portions of the
South taken by the North. He also spoke of the moral tone of the army
as being, on the whole, much higher than represented. There is much
profanity, but as regards intemperance, the men have as much temptation
at home. Intemperance is almost wholly confined to officers. He ended
his address by speaking of various agencies established to secure comfort
for the soldiers. (13)
2725 - L Oct. 4; ed: 2/1 - The New York press insinuates that the
Sanitary commission is guilty of base frauds upon the public. These
insinuations are groundless fabrications, as every one, familiar with
the high and pure character of its managers, knows.
"The Copperheads attack and insult everything which assists in
carrying on the war, and would do the same to the soldiers were they
not anxious for their votes." - - (4)

achieved an overwhelming triumph over the enemies of the Government,
it is the duty of the people of Ohio to make whatever provisions are
necessary to provide for all those who have claims upon the nssistance
of the State by reason of their having sons, brothers, husbands or
fathers in the Union army.

be left to one political party, but all classes should be asked to

as a day for ministering to the wants of soldiers' families. He asks
the people to make every effort to supply all families with wood, flour,
potatoes, apples, buckwheat, and anything else that will contribute to
their welfare.
"The great and noble State of Ohio, that has won imperishable honor
by her devotion to the Union and Freedom, must not allow a single one
of the families of our soldiers to be unprovided." (10)

st. Dec. 9 for the benefit of soldiers on the west side. Leading men
in that section are in charge. (2)
2732 - L. Dec. 5; ed: 2/1 - The Democratic press, as well as the New
York WORLD, has started a vigorous campaign against the Sanitary and
Christian commissions, charging the officials of these organizations
with absorbing most of the money.
"This is a grave charge and should be denied so vigorously by the
commission that it will forever put an end to these efforts to check
the benevolence of the people toward these organizations." (2)
2733 - L. Dec. 12; ed: 2/1 - The Democratic press has attacked operations
of the Sanitary commission.
"The report of the Commission proves that without a doubt, the af-
fairs have been managed above criticism." (3)
2734 - L. Dec. 24; ed:2/1 - The camp and gunboat libraries supplied by
the Christian commission for the soldiers and sailors is a source of
much comfort and enjoyment, enabling them to employ their time use-
fully and pleasantly.
Fourteen hundred and forty libraries supply the army and navy, and
200,000 volumes more are needed to keep these libraries varied. It
is proposed to raise these books during the holidays and the Christian
commission has pledged itself for prompt delivery to the various li-
braries. Everyone who purchases Christmas gifts should buy a book for
his army friends.
"We hope every one of our readers will respond to this appeal of
the commission." (8)

WEAPONS
2742 - L. July 29; ed: 1/2 - War is an awful remedy for curing diseases,
whether civil or foreign in character, and always brings a train of
vices, demoralizes young men, and lessens the reverence in which human
life should be held. Men used to shudder at the very thought of using
firearms; but since the war, they talk freely of using them, which is
absolutely wrong and should be punished to the full extent of the law,
whether they be soldiers or private citizens.
"In view of the growing recklessness of society, and the tendency
of returned soldiers to use arms on the least provocation; in view of
the interests of civilization, and the dignity and honor of the laws
of civilized communities, we invoke all citizens to cultivate a health-
ier public sentiment and save us from the barbarism of dirks and re-
volvers. If we are not to degenerate into a blood-thirsty race of men,
with whom life is of little consequence so long as the murderer has a
provocation, or some wealth to shield him, we must put a check to the
unlicensed use of firearms." (16)

He said things went badly with this large and increasing class until
General Butler issued his famous order "No 14, " whose doctrine was that
the freedmen are the inevitable charge and children of the government.
He stated that before the announcement of that doctrine, "the condition
of the blacks was worse than slavery itself. They were kicked about,
defrauded and abused." But under General Butler's policy the black
colony is growing in every respect. They are thriving in schools, on
farms, and fast learning the science and Art of life." (18)

Women, as a rule, have a crazy extravagance for dress.
